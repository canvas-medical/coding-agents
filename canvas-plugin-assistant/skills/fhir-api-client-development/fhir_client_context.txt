### 
A booking of a healthcare event among patient(s), practitioner(s), related person(s) and/or device(s) for a specific date/time. This may result in one or more Encounter(s).  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/appointment.html>   
This may result in one or more [Encounters](/api/encounter).  
The appointment resource maps to both [patient appointments](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/4617508394-appointment-management) as well as [other events](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/4617508394-appointment-management#scheduling-other-events-30) in Canvas. Instructions for configuring event and note types can be found [here](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/6785045644-appointment-event-note-types).
### Endpoints
post /Appointment get /Appointment/{id} put /Appointment/{id} get /Appointment
post
/Appointment
#### Appointment create
Create an **Appointment**  
It is recommended to utilize the [FHIR Slot Search](/api/slot#search) to find appointment times for a specific practitioner.  
**Prevent Double Booking** By default, Canvas does not prevent appointments from being created if there is already an existing appointment for that provider. However, Canvas has a config setting to disable double booking. If double booking is not allowed and the Appointment Create or Appointment Update request is trying to book an appointment for a given Provider that already has a scheduled appointment at that time, you will see a 422 error status with the following error message returned `This appointment time is no longer available.`
### Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
contained 
array[json] 
Contained, inline Resources. Used to store links for telehealth appointments.
This endpoint allows one custom video meeting link to be passed in that will be utilized on the UI over the default provider's meeting link if the appointment is a telemedicine. You can specify a telehealth meeting link by adding an element in the `SupportingInformation` attribute where the `SupportingInformation.reference` is `#appointment-meeting-endpoint-0` and matches the `contained[0].id` attribute of `appointment-meeting-endpoint-0`. See examples for help.

resourceType 
enum [ Endpoint ] required
id 
string required
The `id` of the contained entry. This needs to be `appointment-meeting-endpoint-0` and the SupportingInformation.reference will be `#appointment-meeting-endpoint-0`.
address 
string required
The technical base address for connecting to this endpoint.
identifier 
array[json] 
External Ids for this item.   
The identifier list defines additional identifiers that are able to be stored for an appointment.  
These identifiers will not be surfaced on the Patient's chart, but they may help you identify the patient in your system by associating your identifier with the resource's `id`.
Click to view child attributes
use 
enum [ usual | official | temp | secondary | old ] 
The purpose of this identifier. If this is omitted, it will default to `usual`.
system 
string 
The namespace for the identifier value.
value 
string 
The value that is unique
assigner 
json 
Text representing Organization that issued id. If ommitted it will default to the system of the identifier.
Click to view child attributes
display 
string 
period 
json 
Time period when id is/was valid for use.
Click to view child attributes
start 
datetime 
Starting time with inclusive boundary. If omitted this will default to `1970-01-01`.
end 
datetime 
End time with inclusive boundary, if not ongoing. If ommitted this will default to `2100-12-31`.
status 
enum [ arrived | booked | cancelled | checked-in | fulfilled | noshow | pending | proposed | entered-in-error ] required
The status of the appointment.   
This table shows the mappings of statuses/states an appointment is in within Canvas to the FHIR status attribute.   
FHIR Status | Canvas Status  
---|---  
proposed | unconfirmed  
pending | attempted  
booked | confirmed  
arrived | arrived  
checked-in | roomed  
fulfilled | exited  
noshow | no-showed  
cancelled | cancelled  
entered-in-error | deleted  
If any of the first 7 FHIR statuses are used, the appointment will appear on the schedule from the dropdown on the Appointment Card in the Schedule view with one of those statuses.   
An appointment can be created as `cancelled` for historical purposes, but it will not appear on the schedule view and will be a restorable note on the patient's timeline.   
The Create endpoint does NOT accept a status of `entered-in-error`.

The style of appointment or patient that has been booked in the slot (not service type). Canvas supports configurable [event and note types](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/6785045644-appointment-event-note-types).
There are a few things to note with this attribute:   
1.If the `appointmentType` attribute is omitted from the body completely, the note type that has `Is default appointment type` will be used (usually Office Visit if unchanged)  
2.If the code / system pair does not exist, you will see a 422 error status with error message `Appointment Type does not exist with code: {code} and system: {system}`   
3.If the code / system pair passed is not marked as `Is Scheduleable` in Canvas, you will get a 422 error status with error message `Note type: {name} is not scheduleable`.

coding 
array[json] 
The type of appointment
Click to view child attributes
system 
string 
The system of the appointment
code 
string 
The code of the appointment.   
This needs to match a coding in the Event and Note Types Canvas Settings and be deemed as Is Scheduleable.
reasonCode 
array[json] 
Coded reason this appointment is scheduled.   
Canvas supports two ways to specify the reason for vist (RFV): [structured](/sdk/data-reason-for-visit/#reasonforvisitsettingcoding) and unstructured. Both the `coding` and `text` attributes are used for Structured RFVs, whereas unstructured RFVs only leverage the `text` attribute.
Canvas only accepts the first item in the reasonCode list.  
If you are taking advantage of our [structured reason for visit](/sdk/data-reason-for-visit/#reasonforvisitsettingcoding) feature, you can provide a `coding` that Canvas can use to look up the `code` value in configured in settings and display the structured RFV matching that code. If `Appointment.reasonCode[0].coding[0].code` is not a valid ReasonForVisitSettingCoding you will get the error "structured reason for visit with code {code} does not exist". You will also receive an error if the RFV code in Canvas' setting's page is not unique.   
The `text` attribute maps to the free text Reason For Visit command. If you are using the structured reason for visit feature, this text will display as the `comment` in the command. If you are not using the structured reason for visit feature, then only `Appointment.reasonCode[0].text` needs to be populated in your message and `coding` should be omitted.   
If this field is omitted (along with the deprecated `description` field), the RFV command in the appointment note will be defaulted to `No description given`.

code 
string 
The code of the reason for visit.
text 
string 
description 
string 
Shown on a subject line in a meeting request, or appointment list.  
This description attribute is useful for Scheduled Events in Canvas that do no have a corresponding timeline entry.  
For appointments associated with a patient timeline entry, we strongly suggest using the `reasonCode` field to map to the Reason For Visit command in a Canvas Note. However, this descrition will match the reasonCode.text attribute in a Read/Search
supportingInformation 
array[json] required
Additional information to support the appointment. Currently, Canvas supports the ability to write 2 different types of references:   
  1. `Location`: A reference to a Location captures what Practice Location in Canvas the appointment will take place at.  
  2. `Meeting Link`: For appointments that are telehealth in Canvas, there can be a reference to an endpoint in this list. The reference attribute will need to match an `id` in the `Appointment.contained` attribute list, but will need to have a `#` in front of the reference string. See examples for help. For telehealth appointments where no meeting link reference is supplied, it will default to the practitioner's personal meeting room link as defined in Canvas Settings.
Click to view child attributes
reference 
string required
The reference string of the supporting information.
If the entry is for a Location the format will be `"Location/9d3a079f-22c0-4918-96d7-72eb567563ec"`. You can retrieve this information for a [Location Search](/api/location#search).  
If the entry is for a virtual meeting link, the reference should be `#appointment-meeting-endpoint-0`.
type 
string 
Type the reference refers to (e.g. "Location", "Endpoint", "Encounter", "Appointment").
start 
datetime required
When appointment is to take place.
The `start` attribute determines the start timestamp of the appointment. It is written in [instant format for FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#instant). Seconds and milliseconds can be omitted, but YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM are required.
end 
datetime required
When appointment is to conclude.
The end attribute is used with the start timestamp to determine the duration in minutes of the appointment. The duration of the appointment must be greater than 0 minutes. It is written in [instant format for FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#instant). Seconds and milliseconds can be omitted, but YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM are required.
participant 
array[json] required
Participants involved in appointment. At least one object needs to be supplied that corresponds to the practitioner, there will always be a practitioner involved in every appointment type. An optional 2nd object corresponding to the patient reference will be accepted if the `appointmentType` allows/requires a patient participant.

supportingInformation 
array[json] 
Additional information to support the appointment. Currently, Canvas supports different types of references in this list:   
  1. `Location`: A reference to a Location captures what Practice Location in Canvas the appointment will take place at.  
  2. `Meeting Link`: For appointments that are telehealth in Canvas, there will be a reference to an endpoint in this list. The reference attribute will match an `id` in the `Appointment.contained` attribute list. That element will display the url address of the virtual meeting link.   
  3. `Appointment`: If an appointment has been rescheduled, this list could display an associated Appointment reference. If you see a display of `Previously Rescheduled Appointment`, it means that the appointment you are currently looking at was created after rescheduling the appointment in that Reference. If you see a display of `Rescheduled Replacement Appointment`, it means that the appointment you are currently looking at is now outdated by a new appointment. If you see a display of `Co-scheduled Appointment`, it means that the appointment you are currently looking at was scheduled with other additional associated appointments for which the appointment reference ID is noted.   
  4. `Encounter`: If there is any encounter associated with the appointment made in Canvas, the reference will appear in this list.

#### Appointment update
Update an **Appointment** This is almost identical to the [Appointment Create](/api/appointment/#create). The update will only affect fields that are passed in to the body, if any fields are omitted they will be ignored and kept as they are currently set in the Canvas database.   
A FHIR Appointment update interaction behaves differently than a rescheduling workflow in the Canvas UI. FHIR updates will directly modify the Appointment referred to by the `id` rather than creating a new appointment.  
Canvas prevents updating the patient an appointment is already associated to. Best practices is to cancel the existing appointment and create a new appointment with the correct patient.
### Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
id 
string required
The identifier of the appointment.
contained 
array[json] 
Contained, inline Resources. Used to store links for telehealth appointments.
This endpoint allows one custom video meeting link to be passed in that will be utilized on the UI over the default provider's meeting link if the appointment is a telemedicine. You can specify a telehealth meeting link by adding an element in the `SupportingInformation` attribute where the `SupportingInformation.reference` is `#appointment-meeting-endpoint-0` and matches the `contained[0].id` attribute of `appointment-meeting-endpoint-0`. See examples for help.
Click to view child attributes
resourceType 
enum [ Endpoint ] required
id 
string required
The `id` of the contained entry. This needs to be `appointment-meeting-endpoint-0` and the SupportingInformation.reference will be `#appointment-meeting-endpoint-0`.
address 
string required
The technical base address for connecting to this endpoint.
identifier 
array[json] 
External Ids for this item.   
The identifier list defines additional identifiers that are able to be stored for an appointment.  
These identifiers will not be surfaced on the Patient's chart, but they may help you identify the patient in your system by associating your identifier with the resource's `id`.
To update an existing `identifier`, include the `id` in the `identifier[x].id` field returned from Read/Search.  
The `identifier` section sent in an update will entirely replace existing identifiers currently within the period.start and period.end dates.  
If an `identifier` already exists in the Canvas database and is not included in the Update message, it will be deleted if and only if the period.end date is in the future.

status 
enum [ arrived | booked | cancelled | checked-in | fulfilled | noshow | pending | proposed | entered-in-error ] required
The status of the appointment.   
This table shows the mappings of statuses/states an appointment is in within Canvas to the FHIR status attribute.   
FHIR Status | Canvas Status  
---|---  
proposed | unconfirmed  
pending | attempted  
booked | confirmed  
arrived | arrived  
checked-in | roomed  
fulfilled | exited  
noshow | no-showed  
cancelled | cancelled  
entered-in-error | deleted  
If any of the first 7 FHIR statuses are used, the appointment will appear on the schedule from the dropdown on the Appointment Card in the Schedule view with one of those statuses.   
An appointment can be updated to `cancelled` and as a result it will disappear from the schedule view and/or will be a restorable note on the patient's timeline. Once an appointment is in a cancelled state, it should not be updated to a different status via FHIR, instead the note should be reverted directly in the Patient's chart before it can be updated via FHIR again.   
The Update endpoint does NOT accept a status of `entered-in-error`.
appointmentType 
json 
The style of appointment or patient that has been booked in the slot (not service type). Canvas supports configurable [event and note types](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/6785045644-appointment-event-note-types).
There are a few things to note with this attribute:   
  1. If the `appointmentType` is an Other Event that does not require a patient, you must provide the `appointmentType` in the upload payload to pass validation.   
  2. For all appointments that require a patient, if the `appointmentType` attribute is omitted from the body completely on an update, the note type will stay as it already is in Canvas.  
  3. If the code / system pair does not exist, you will see a 422 error status with error message `Appointment Type does not exist with code: {code} and system: {system}`   
  4. If the code / system pair passed is not marked as `Is Scheduleable` in Canvas, you will get a 422 error status with error message `Note type: {name} is not scheduleable`.

reasonCode 
array[json] 
Coded reason this appointment is scheduled.   
Canvas supports two ways to specify the reason for vist (RFV): [structured](/sdk/data-reason-for-visit/#reasonforvisitsettingcoding) and unstructured. Both the `coding` and `text` attributes are used for Structured RFVs, whereas unstructured RFVs only leverage the `text` attribute.
On an update, if the reasonCode has changed from what is already saved in Canvas, it will create a new RFV command on that appointment. The old reason for visit will be marked as entered-in-error, and the text will no longer display. Below is an example of what an appointment's note will look like after changing the description multiple times. The originator and entered-in-error will be set to Canvas Bot, which can be seen if you click on the crossed off "Reason for Visit".  
![api-update-rfv](/assets/images/api-update-rfv.png)  
If this field is omitted (along with the deprecated `description` field), the RFV command in the appointment note will stay as it currently is.

Additional information to support the appointment. Currently, Canvas supports the ability to write 2 different types of references:   
  1. `Location`: A reference to a Location captures what Practice Location in Canvas the appointment will take place at.  
  2. `Meeting Link`: For appointments that are telehealth in Canvas, there can be a reference to an endpoint in this list. The reference attribute will need to match an `id` in the `Appointment.contained` attribute list, but will need to have a `#` in front of the reference string. See examples for help. For telehealth appointments where no meeting link reference is supplied, it will default to the practitioner's personal meeting room link as defined in Canvas Settings.

status 
enum [ arrived | booked | cancelled | checked-in | fulfilled | noshow | pending | proposed | entered-in-error ] 
The status of the appointment.   
This table shows the mappings of statuses/states an appointment is in within Canvas to the FHIR status attribute.   
FHIR Status | Canvas Status  
---|---  
proposed | unconfirmed  
pending | attempted  
booked | confirmed  
arrived | arrived  
checked-in | roomed  
fulfilled | exited  
noshow | no-showed  
cancelled | cancelled  
entered-in-error | deleted  
The first 7 statuses come from the dropdown on the Appointment Card in the Schedule view. A `cancelled` status comes from a patient appointment or an other event being cancelled. The `deleted/entered-in-error` status is when a checked-in appointment note has been deleted in Canvas.
appointmentType 
json 
The style of appointment or patient that has been booked in the slot (not service type). Canvas supports configurable [event and note types](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/6785045644-appointment-event-note-types).
Click to view child attributes
coding 
array[json] 
The type of appointment
Click to view child attributes
system 
string 
The system of the appointment
code 
string 
The code of the appointment.   
This needs to match a coding in the Event and Note Types Canvas Settings and be deemed as Is Scheduleable.
display 
string 
The display of the appointment
reasonCode 
array[json] 
Coded reason this appointment is scheduled.   
Canvas supports two ways to specify the reason for vist (RFV): [structured](/sdk/data-reason-for-visit/#reasonforvisitsettingcoding) and unstructured. Both the `coding` and `text` attributes are used for Structured RFVs, whereas unstructured RFVs only leverage the `text` attribute.

coding 
array[json] 
Code defined by a terminology system.
Click to view child attributes
system 
string 
The system of the coding.
code 
string 
The code of the reason for visit.
display 
string 
The display name of the coding.
userSelected 
boolean 
If this coding was chosen directly by the user. In Canvas this indicates if the coding is currently active or not.
text 
string 
description 
string 
Shown on a subject line in a meeting request, or appointment list.  
This description attribute is useful for Scheduled Events in Canvas that do no have a corresponding timeline entry.  
For appointments associated with a patient timeline entry, we strongly suggest using the `reasonCode` field to map to the Reason For Visit command in a Canvas Note. However, this descrition will match the reasonCode.text attribute in a Read/Search
supportingInformation 
array[json] 
Additional information to support the appointment. Currently, Canvas supports different types of references in this list:   
  1. `Location`: A reference to a Location captures what Practice Location in Canvas the appointment will take place at.  
  2. `Meeting Link`: For appointments that are telehealth in Canvas, there will be a reference to an endpoint in this list. The reference attribute will match an `id` in the `Appointment.contained` attribute list. That element will display the url address of the virtual meeting link.   
  3. `Appointment`: If an appointment has been rescheduled, this list could display an associated Appointment reference. If you see a display of `Previously Rescheduled Appointment`, it means that the appointment you are currently looking at was created after rescheduling the appointment in that Reference. If you see a display of `Rescheduled Replacement Appointment`, it means that the appointment you are currently looking at is now outdated by a new appointment. If you see a display of `Co-scheduled Appointment`, it means that the appointment you are currently looking at was scheduled with other additional associated appointments for which the appointment reference ID is noted.   
  4. `Encounter`: If there is any encounter associated with the appointment made in Canvas, the reference will appear in this list.

##  Introduction 
The OAuth 2.0 authentication/authorization flow differs from the traditional username/password flow still heavily used in healthcare interoperability. To help users new to writing applications using OAuth, here are some best practices recommended by Canvas.
###  The Access Token: Don't lose it, reuse it 
####  Instead of this 
For some connections requiring a username and password, it may be necessary to use those credentials every time a message is sent to that system. In that type of flow, you might need to write something like:
    ```python
    import requests
    token = get_new_auth_token()
    patient = get_patient(token, patient_id)
    updated_patient_body = update_patient(patient, name="Frank")
    token = get_new_auth_token()
    update_patient(token, updated_patient_body)
    token = get_new_auth_token()
    schedule_appointment(token, patient=patient, type="telehealth")
    ...
    ```
Repeated, unnecessary calls to a token request function double the number of requests this script generates.
####  Do this 
Regardless of the authentication method used, a successful request includes `"expires_in": ` in the response body. The corresponding value will be an integer for the number of seconds until the token will be expired in Canvas. By reusing the token and eliminating redundant token requests, there is a **performance** gain from reducing the overall number of requests. The system is also more **secure** \- having fewer tokens reduces the overall surface area for illegitamate access
**General Guidelines:**
  - store the access token as securely as the client id and secret
  - depending on your use case, it may be best to store a token just for that session or to reuse it until it nears expiration
  - store the expiration datetime as well and check it before requesting a new token
  - use a refresh token if you provided in the authentication response for the authentication flow being used
There's any number of ways to do this in your language of choice. In Python, your code may look more like:
    ```python
    import os
    import requests
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    from urllib.parse import urlencode
    # we should get these from environment variables or a secure location at runtime, not in the code
    CLIENT_ID = os.getenv("CANVAS_API_CLIENT_ID")
    CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv("CANVAS_API_CLIENT_SECRET")
    FUMAGE_BASE_URL = os.getenv("FUMAGE_BASE_URL")
    def get_new_auth_token():
        # Auth tokens are requested from the EMR instance, not the FHIR API.
        url = FUMAGE_BASE_URL.replace("fumage-", "")
        payload = urlencode(
            {
                "grant_type": "client_credentials",
                "client_id": f"{CLIENT_ID}",
                "client_secret": f"{CLIENT_SECRET}"
            }
        )
        headers = { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", }
        response = requests.post(f"{url}/auth/token/", headers=headers, data=payload)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            access_token = response.json()["access_token"]
            expiration_date = datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=response.json()["expires_in"])
            os.environ["CANVAS_API_ACCESS_TOKEN"] = access_token
            os.environ["CANVAS_ACESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_DATE"] = expiration_date.strftime("%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S")
            return response.json()["access_token"]
        else:
            raise Exception(f"Could not acquire new auth token: {response.text}")
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        access_token = os.getenv("CANVAS_API_ACCESS_TOKEN")
        if expiration_date := os.getenv("CANVAS_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_DATE"):
            expiration_date = datetime.strptime(expiration_date, "%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S")
        else:
            expiration_date = datetime.now()
         # only request a new token when we do not have a token or the one we have has expired
        if not access_token or expiration_date <= datetime.now():
            access_token = get_new_auth_token()
        headers = { "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}" }
        response = requests.get(f"{FUMAGE_BASE_URL}/Patient?name=Briddle", headers=headers)
        if response.status_code == 401:
            # attempt to acquire a new token 1 time if we get a 401 - maybe it was manually expired or
            # we have the wrong expiration date
            access_token = get_new_auth_token()
            headers = { "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}" }
            response = requests.get(f"{FUMAGE_BASE_URL}/Patient?name=Briddle", headers=headers)
            if response.status_code == 401:
                # limit retries but throw a specific exception for authentication related issues
                raise Exception(f"Cannot authenticate to Canvas after 1 retry: {response.text}")
            elif response.status_code != 200:
                # capture other issues as well
                raise Exception(f"{response.text}")
        patients = response.json()["entry"]
        for patient in patients:
            patient_id = patient["resource"]["id"]
            response = requests.get(f"{FUMAGE_BASE_URL}/Appointment?patient=Patient/{patient_id}")
            # do something with the appointments - save locally, modify and update, etc.
    ```
####  Takeaway 
  - **Safely stored access tokens can and should be reused!**

### 
The Care Team includes all the people and organizations who plan to participate in the coordination and delivery of care for a patient.  
<http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-careteam.html>  
All patients in Canvas have a CareTeam by default. The identifier for the CareTeam resource for a patient is the same as the patient identifier.   
See our [article](https://help.canvasmedical.com/articles/5628604712-manage-care-teams) for information about setting up Care Teams and Care Team Roles in Canvas.
### Endpoints
get /CareTeam/{id} put /CareTeam/{id} get /CareTeam
get
/CareTeam/{id}
#### CareTeam read
Read a CareTeam resource.
### Path Parameters
id required
string 
The unique identifier for the CareTeam   
The default behavior is to return all active care team participants for the patient. To return care team participants of a different status, add `.status` at the end of the ID (e.g `CareTeam/3e72c07b5aac4dc5929948f82c9afdfd.inactive`).
### Response Payload Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
id 
string 
The identifier of the CareTeam.

display 
string 
Display name of patient in the format `<patient_last_name>, <patient_first_name>`
participant 
array[json] 
Members of the team.  
Canvas allows either internal practitioners or external organizations to be members of a patient CareTeam. A practitioner can only have one role on a CareTeam, and only one practitioner can have a given role on a CareTeam. Organizations cannot be the lead of a CareTeam.   
Click to view child attributes

put
/CareTeam/{id}
#### CareTeam update
Update a CareTeam resource.  
The CareTeam update endpoint acts as an upsert, so there is no CareTeam `create` endpoint. Any participants included in the payload will be the patient's active care team participants. While any participants no longer included in the payload will be marked as `inactive`.   
**If-Unmodified-Since Header** :  
Due to a legacy design detail with the CareTeam implementation, there is a specific condition under which inclusion of this header will not produce expected results. In the case where all participants of a CareTeam are removed through the Canvas user interface (i.e. not through the FHIR API), the last modified date for the CareTeam will be equal to the last modified date of the patient record until another participant is added to the CareTeam.  
More information about the If-Unmodified-Since header can be found in the [Conditional Requests documentation](/api/conditional-requests/).

##  Software Requirements 
Software requirements for retrieving C-CDA via API calls can be found [here](/api/software-requirements)
##  Authentication 
If you have a Canvas Production instance, you will need to request a token and refresh it periodically. You can refer to our [Authentication Documentation](/api/customer-authentication) to get you set up.
##  Request and Parameters 
In order to generate a CCDA for a known patient key, you'll need to do a GET request to the endpoint `{YOUR_EHR_INSTANCE}/api/data-export/ccda/{patient_key}?document={document_type}`, where `document_type` can be either `continuity` or `referral`. You can check all parameters in the table below.
Parameter Name | Description | Requirement  
---|---|---  
document | Document type to be generated.  
Should be either `continuity` or `referral` | Mandatory  
start_date | Filter for the start date of the sections within the document.  
Format should be `YYYY-MM-DD` | Optional  
end_date | Filter for the end date of the sections within the document.  
Format should be `YYYY-MM-DD` | Optional  
generation_date | Overrides the generation date of the document.  
Format should be `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss`, in UTC timezone | Optional  
##  Filtering 
`start_date` and `end_date` filter can be used to:
  - filter by a range of dates by inputing both parameters;
  - filter by a single date in the past by making `start_date` and `end_date` the same;
  - filter starting at a date in the past up until present time by only setting `start_date`;
  - filter from the beginning of time up to any date by only setting `end_date`;
##  Example and Response 
Here's a cURL example of a request for a continuity of care document, filtered for 2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31, and with a generation date of 2022-01-01, at 16:30 UTC:
    ```shell
    curl --request GET --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "<practice_subdomain>.canvasmedical.com/api/data-export/ccda/{PATIENT_KEY}?document=continuity&start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-12-31&generation_date=2025-07-31T16:30:00"
    ```
A valid request will always return XML with the requested document as the response. If the `document` param is omitted, an empty XML will be returned.
##  Errors 
Canvas uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a request wasn't found, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Canvas' server.
Error | Description  
---|---  
200 - OK | Everything worked as expected.  
403 - Forbidden | No valid Bearer token provided.  
404 - Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist.  
500 - Server Error | Something went wrong on Canvas's end.

### 
An occurrence of information being transmitted; e.g. a message that was sent to a responsible provider  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/communication.html>  
The Communication resource maps to messages in Canvas between a patient and practitioner. Click [here](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/6255444430-patient-message-inbox) to learn more.  
**Additional HTML formatting**  
With the release of Advanced Letter Templates, Messages are now saved in the database in HTML format. Customers using the Communication endpoint for their own patient applications will need to take this into account either by embedding the html directly using a library like Interweave or extracting the text. **Messages sent before this update (10/26/2022 @ 17:00 PST) will remain in plain text format.**  
### Endpoints
post /Communication get /Communication/{id} get /Communication

### 
A clinical condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern.  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-condition-problems-health-concerns.html>
### Endpoints
post /Condition get /Condition/{id} put /Condition/{id} get /Condition
post
/Condition
#### Condition create
Create a Condition resource.  
This endpoint does not prevent duplicates in the record. **Canvas recommends performing a search prior to adding a new condition** to confirm whether the condition has already been created for the patient.  
If `clinicalStatus` is **active** , the Condition will be added as a `Diagnose` command. If it is not **active** , the Condition will be added as a `Past Medical History` command.  
If an `encounter` or a note ID in the `extension` is provided, the Condition will be added to the existing encounter (note). If it is not provided, a new data import note will be created.
### Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
extension 
array[json] 
Canvas supports a note identifier extension on this resource. The note identifier can be used with the [Canvas Note API](/api/note).
Canvas recommends sending the note identifier extension or the Encounter reference, but not both. If both are supplied, they must both refer to the same note. If neither is specified, it will insert into a Data Import note where the DOS is the current time of ingestion.

##  If-Unmodified-Since 
Endpoints that perform update operations support the conditional header [If-Unmodified-Since](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Unmodified-Since).
If a request includes this header, then updates will be rejected if the stored resource has been modified since the date specified in the header, and a 412 Precondition Failed response will be returned.
The date should be in the format specified by [RFC 2616](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616).

### 
A record of a healthcare consumer's choices, which permits or denies identified recipient(s) or recipient role(s) to perform one or more actions within a given policy context, for specific purposes and periods of time.  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/consent.html>   
For more information on consents in canvas, see this [article](https://help.canvasmedical.com/articles/8144965836-manging-patient-consents).
### Endpoints
post /Consent get /Consent/{id} get /Consent
post
/Consent
#### Consent create
Before creating a consent via the API, Patient Consent Codings **must** be [configured in Canvas](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/8727821967-patient-consents).  
**Updating existing patient consent objects**  
A patient consent is uniquely distinguished by its patient and consent coding  
This Create endpoint also acts as an Update endpoint. If the patient already has an existing patient consent with the same consent coding, the endpoint updates that consent in place and the id returned in the response will not be changed.

status 
enum [ active | cancelled ] required
The status of the Coverage.   
In Canvas, the status of `active` means it appears in the Patient's Profile page either under the main or other coverage sections, while a status of `cancelled` means it was removed and no longer appears on the page. An expired coverage will still show as `active`, so be sure to set/read the `period.end` attribute.
Currently there is no way to create a coverage that appears under the "Other Coverages" section on the Patient Profile. All coverages created with `active` will appear as the primary, secondary, tertiary, etc coverage depending on the order number. Coverages created with a `cancelled` status will not appear on the UI, but can still be read out.
type 
json 
Type of coverage, such as medical, workers compensation, self pay, etc.  
In order for this value to display on the Canvas UI, the coverage type needs to be configured for the specific payor via our insurer settings. To get to these settings, see this [Pylon article](https://help.canvasmedical.com/articles/5877696655-patient-coverages#managing-insurers-68).

### 
The CoverageEligibilityRequest provides patient and insurance coverage information to an insurer for them to respond, in the form of an CoverageEligibilityResponse, with information regarding whether the stated coverage is valid and in-force.  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/coverageeligibilityrequest.html>
### Endpoints
post /CoverageEligibilityRequest
post
/CoverageEligibilityRequest
#### CoverageEligibilityRequest create
If Claim.MD is set up in your Canvas instance, a creation of a coverage CoverageEligibilityRequest will kick off a request to Claim.MD to fetch the eligibility information. Use the returned `id` in the response.headers['location'] attribute to perform a [CoverageEligibilityResponse Search](/api/coverageeligibilityresponse/#search) to see what response Claim.MD returned.
### Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
status 
string required
Describes the state the request is in.
**Value Options Supported:**
  - active 
purpose 
array[string] required
What information is being requested.  
Supported values: only **["benefits"]** is valid
patient 
json required
Canvas patient resource whom the CoverageEligibilityRequest is for.
Click to view child attributes
reference 
string required
The reference string of the subject in the format of `"Patient/a39cafb9d1b445be95a2e2548e12a787"`.
type 
string 
Type the reference refers to (e.g. "Patient").
created 
date required
Creation date, required by the FHIR specification, but unused by Canvas as it will be defaulted to the Canvas ingestion timestamp.  
Canvas recommends sending the current datetime in ISO 8601 format.
insurer 
json required
Coverage issuer, required by the FHIR schema but unused by Canvas because we inherit the issuer directly from the Coverage resource provided.  
Canvas recommends setting `insurer` to `{}`.
insurance 
array[json] required
Patient insurance information.  
Canvas requires a single coverage resource identifying the insurance to check eligibility against.
Click to view child attributes
json required
Insurance information.
Click to view child attributes
reference 
string required
The reference string of the coverage in the format of `"Coverage/f7663d7b-13bd-4236-843e-086306aea125"`.
### Responses
201 Created 
The server has successfully processed the request; the new resource has been created and is now ready for interaction.  
Canvas returns the created resource's id as a UUID within the `location` header and a `null` response body. 
### Errors
400 Bad Request 
The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. An accompanying error message will explain further. 
401 Unauthorized 
The request requires user authentication. 
403 Forbidden 
The request requires user authorization. 
405 Method Not Allowed

### 
The CoverageEligibilityResponse resource provides eligibility and plan details from processing a CoverageEligibilityRequest resource. It combines key information from a payor as to whether a Coverage is in-force, and optionally the nature of the Policy benefit details as well as the ability for the insurer to indicate whether the insurance provides benefits for requested types of services or requires preauthorization and if so what supporting information may be required.

##  Introduction 
  - Canvas is an OAuth 2.0 authorization server.
  - This page contains information about how you can create third-party applications within your Canvas EHR instance and use those applications to access the FHIR API.
  - Canvas supports most OAuth flows, but this document will focus on two of the most used: 
    - **Client Credentials** : Mostly used for Machine-to-Machine authentication (e.g., CLIs, Daemons).
    - **Authorization Code** : Usually used for web/native applications since it requires a user to log in to the system.
##  Registering a third-party application on Canvas 
  - Registering a third-party application is always the first step.
  - In order to do so, you'll need to: 
    1. Go to `{YOUR_CANVAS_EHR_INSTANCE}/auth/applications/` where you'll see the following page: ![Authorization Page](/assets/images/ed67823-Screenshot_2021-10-26_at_16.22.31.png)
    2. Once you click the link on that page, you'll see the following: ![Application Registration](/assets/images/8b49344-Screenshot_2021-10-26_at_16.24.01.png)
    - You'll need to set a name for the app, set the `Client type` to `Confidential`, choose one of the `Authorization grant types`, and set the `Redirect URIs` if needed. Leave the `Algorithm` at `No OIDC support` for now.
    - Here's how it should look if you created a new "Test Application" with the `client-credentials` grant type: ![Application Example](/assets/images/6190a01-Screenshot_2021-10-26_at_16.26.59.png)
    - That's it. Take note of your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, and proceed to the section related to the `Authorization Grant Type` you chose.
##  Client Credentials 
  - The Client Credentials flow assumes that everyone involved is capable of securely storing the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
  - In order to get a token, you just need to:
    ```shell
    curl --request POST '{YOUR_CANVAS_EHR_INSTANCE}/auth/token/' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
    --data-urlencode 'client_id={YOUR_CLIENT_ID}' \
    --data-urlencode 'client_secret={YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET}'
    ```
and you'll get back a JSON which will contain an `access_token` that'll be valid for 10 hours.
##  Authorization Code 
The Authorization Code flow has a lot more steps to ensure a user of the Canvas EHR explicitly approves the token request. It's also typically used by web/mobile applications, due to the need for requiring explicit permission from a user logged into the Canvas EHR.
The basic steps are:
  - The application opens a browser to the Canvas EHR instance.
  - The logged-in user sees the authorization prompt and approves the request.
  - The user is redirected back to the `redirect_url` with an authorization code in the query string.
  - The application exchanges the authorization code for an access token.
Note that if you use this Flow, you will need to add redirect URIs when creating an application. That's the URI that will receive the authorization code.
  1. On your browser, open `{YOUR_CANVAS_EHR_INSTANCE}/auth/authorize/?response_type=code&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&scope={LIST_OF_SCOPES}&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI_AS_DEFINED_ON_THE_APPLICATION}`. This will prompt the logged-in user to authorize the Application. Upon authorization, the flow will redirect to the {REDIRECT_URI_AS_DEFINED_ON_THE_APPLICATION} with a code on the query string. You'll need that code next.
  2. Now you need to exchange the code received in the previous step for an access token. For that, run the following:
    ```shell
    curl --request POST '{YOUR_CANVAS_EHR_INSTANCE}/auth/token/' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    --data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
    --data-urlencode 'client_id={CLIENT_ID}' \
    --data-urlencode 'client_secret={CLIENT_SECRET}' \
    --data-urlencode 'redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI_AS_DEFINED_ON_THE_APPLICATION}' \
    --data-urlencode 'code={CODE_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP}'
    ```
And you'll get back an access token JSON that looks like the following:
    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "AN ACCESS TOKEN",
      "expires_in": 36000,
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "scope": "List of accepted scopes here",
      "refresh_token": "A REFRESH TOKEN"
    }
    ```
Notice the refresh token there, which doesn't exist for the Client Credentials flow.
Since the `code` granted when the user authorizes the application is very short-lived, the refresh token allows for seamless revalidation of a token. This refresh token never expires but can only be used once. In order to request a new token, you need to issue the following request:
    ```shell
    curl --request POST '{YOUR_CANVAS_EHR_INSTANCE}/auth/token/' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    --data-urlencode 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
    --data-urlencode 'client_id={CLIENT_ID}' \
    --data-urlencode 'client_secret={CLIENT_SECRET}' \
    --data-urlencode 'redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI_AS_DEFINED_ON_THE_APPLICATION}' \
    --data-urlencode 'refresh_token={REFRESH_TOKEN}' \
    --data-urlencode 'scope={LIST_OF_SCOPES}'
    ```
and you'll get a brand new access token.
##  Scopes 
Scopes are useful to prevent access to unwanted parts of the API. If you're using the Client Credentials Flow, Scopes are optional, and if omitted, you'll have full access to the FHIR API. Be mindful of that.
If you're using the Authorization Code Flow, you need to pass scopes as part of your requests. These scopes follow the [Clinical Scope Syntax](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2/scopes-and-launch-context.html#clinical-scope-syntax) set by HL7. If you are passing more than one scope, they need to be separated by a space like `scope=offline_access user/*.read`
Since Canvas currently works on a User level (e.g., the logged-in user isn't a Patient), the most relevant scopes can be found [here](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2/scopes-and-launch-context.html#user-level-scopes).
In short, they have the form: `user/(resourceType|*).(c|r|u|s)`, where `resourceType` can be one of the supported resources (e.g., `Patient`, `Practitioner`, etc.) or a wildcard `*`. The requested permissions come after the period, and can be `c`, `r`, `u`, or `s` for `create`, `read`, `update`, and `search` respectively.

A few of the API Search endpoints support date search parameters. You have the ability to filter a Resources query result by a specific date or a date range. For more details, see https://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#prefix
We support the following date search modifiers:
  - `ge`   
Greater than or equal to the date.  
Example: `"?date=ge2021-01-01"``
  - `gt` Strictly greater than the date.   
Example: `"?date=gt2021-01-01"`
  - `le` Less than or equal to the date.   
Example: `"?date=le2021-01-01"`
  - `lt` Strictly less than the date.   
Example: `"?date=lt2021-01-01"`
  - `eq` Strictly equal to the date.   
Example: `"?date=eq2021-01-01"`
  - `ne` Not equal to the date.   
Example: `"?date=ne2021-01-01"`  
You can supply multiple date search parameters to search in a range. For example if we want to find all the records within 2024-04-11 and 2024-04-20, we can pass `?date=ge2024-04-11&date=le2024-04-20`
The API endpoints that support date search parameters include:
  - [AllergyIntolerance](/api/allergyintolerance/) (/AllergyIntolerance) - Filter by recorded date
  - [Appointment](/api/appointment/) (/Appointment) - Filter by appointment date
  - [CarePlan](/api/careplan/) (/CarePlan) - Filter by care plan date/period
  - [CareTeam](/api/careteam/) (/CareTeam) - Filter by care team period
  - [Consent](/api/consent/) (/Consent) - Filter by consent date
  - [DiagnosticReport](/api/diagnosticreport/) (/DiagnosticReport) - Filter by report date
  - [DocumentReference](/api/documentreference/) (/DocumentReference) - Filter by document date
  - [Encounter](/api/encounter/) (/Encounter) - Filter by encounter date/period
  - [Immunization](/api/immunization/) (/Immunization) - Filter by immunization date
  - [Observation](/api/observation/) (/Observation) - Filter by observation date/time
  - [Procedure](/api/procedure/) (/Procedure) - Filter by procedure date

##  create-lab-report 
Creates a lab report, lab tests, lab values, and a stored PDF in Canvas.
This endpoint is a [FHIR operation](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operations.html) and was developed as a convenience method in order to post all data associated with a lab report in a single request. In order to adhere to the FHIR standard, the request structure for creating lab reports is in the [Parameters](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/parameters.html) format. This means that an array of named parameter resources makes up the body of the request.
In the example below, the first object in the parameter array is a named parameter called `labReport`. This references a `DiagnosticReport` resource. The `subject` attribute passed here must contain a valid patient reference and the `presentedForm` attribute must contain a base64-encoded string of the report PDF. Only one `labReport` parameter is allowed per payload.
The subsequent parameters in the array must be named `labTestCollection`. These represent the lab tests performed and associated result values. Each `labTestCollection` has a `part` array with `labTest` and `labValue` parameters. Only one `labTest` parameter is allowed per `labTestCollection`. Multiple `labValue` parameters are allowed per `labTestCollection`. Both resources must be represented as `Observation` resources.
To mark a lab value as abnormal, an optional `interpretation` attribute can be added to a `labValue` `Observation` resource. **Only abnormal interpretations (`"code": "A"`)** are currently supported, and the payload must match the structure shown in the example below.
For the values/units in each `labValue` object, either a `valueQuantity` or `valueString` can be supplied in the payload. For example:
    ```json
    ...,
    "valueQuantity": {
        "value": "0.7",
        "unit": "mg/dL",
        "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
    },
    ...
    ```
or
    ```json
    ...,
    "valueString": "Normal",
    ...
    ```
If using `valueQuantity` and a comparator value is needed (i.e. `<1.0`), the comparator value can be passed in a `comparator` key like so:
    ```json
    ...,
    "valueQuantity": {
        "value": "1.0",
        "unit": "mg/dL",
        "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
        "comparator": "<"
    },
    ...
    ```
Supported `comparator` values are `<`, `<=`, `>=`, and `>`.
> **Warning:** While lab tests can be posted and are visible in the Canvas UI, they are not currently available to be read through the FHIR API. Only lab values can be read through the Observation resource. 
The bearer token included in requests send to this endpoint must have one of the following scopes:
  - `system/DiagnosticReport.create-lab-report`
  - `user/DiagnosticReport.create-lab-report`
  - **curl**
        ```shell
        curl -X POST "https://fumage-example.canvasmedical.com/DiagnosticReport/\$create-lab-report" \

### 
A reference to a document of any kind for any purpose. Provides metadata about the document so that the document can be discovered and managed. The scope of a document is any seralized object with a mime-type, so includes formal patient centric documents (CDA), clinical notes, scanned paper, and non-patient specific documents like policy text.  
<http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-documentreference.html>  
A Document Reference can represent many different PDFs generated in Canvas:
  - A [Letter](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/8181146406-letters) that has been faxed or printed from the patient's chart.
  - All documents uploaded via [Data Integration](https://help.canvasmedical.com/articles/7371085164-data-integration) and linked to a Patient. This includes Lab Reports, Imaging Reports, Referral Reports, Clinical, and Administrative Documents.
  - [POC Lab Commands](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/7060961677-point-of-care-poc-tests) committed on the Patient's chart
  - [Clinical Notes](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/1679996479-print-patient-chart) representing a PDF of each locked note. This also includes superseded versions on notes.
  - Any [Educational Material](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/4966226408-educational-material-command) committed on a patient's chart.
  - Any [Invoices](https://help.canvasmedical.com/articles/9992348572-claim-management#invoicing-statements-128) generated for a patient.

### 
An interaction between a patient and healthcare provider(s) for the purpose of providing healthcare service(s) or assessing the health status of a patient.  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/encounter.html>  
**Encounter creation in Canvas**  
An encounter is associated with some of our notes in Canvas. For our default base notes, an encounter will be created with these note types:   
\- Lab visit   
\- Phone visit   
\- Telehealth visit   
\- Office visit   
\- Home Visit   
\- In-patient Visit   
With our [Configurable Note Types Feature](https://help.canvasmedical.com/articles/6785045644-appointment-event-note-types) all custom note types will be associated with an encounter by default.

Canvas uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a request wasn't found, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Canvas' server.
All `4xx` errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., resource not found) include an [OperationOutcome](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html) that explains the error reported
Error Code | Description  
---|---  
200 - OK | Everything worked as expected.  
401 - Unauthorized | No valid Bearer token provided.  
403 - Forbidden | Token bearer is forbidden from performing the operation.  
404 - Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist.  
422 - Unprocessable Entity | There operation cannot be completed because of an error in the request body; details are provided in the returned OperationOutcome  
5XX - Server Error | Something went wrong on Canvas's end.

### 
Represents a defined collection of entities that may be discussed or acted upon collectively but which are not expected to act collectively, and are not formally or legally recognized; i.e. a collection of entities that isn't an Organization.  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/group.html>  
In Canvas Teams and Patient Groups are mapped to the FHIR Group resource.   
See this [Pylon article](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/5123845479-teams) for information about creating teams in Canvas.  
See this [Pylon article](https://help.canvasmedical.com/articles/8319995182-patient-groups) for information about patient groups in Canvas.
### Endpoints
post /Group get /Group/{id} put /Group/{id} get /Group
post
/Group
#### Group create
Create a Group resource.  
**Note:** The Canvas implementation of Group create/update assigns responsibilities to practitioner Groups using the `characteristic` attribute, rather than using the `characteristic` attribute to establish membership.
### Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
type 
string required
Identifies the broad classification of the kind of resources the group includes.   
A group with type `person` refers to a Patient Group in canvas, while a group of type `practitioner` refers to a Team in Canvas.
**Value Options Supported:**
  - person 
  - practitioner 
actual 
boolean required
If true, indicates that the resource refers to a specific group of real individuals. If false, the group defines a set of intended individuals.   
While this is a required field in FHIR, Canvas assumes all groups are made up of real individuals, so this will be assumed True for all interactions.
name 
string required
Label for Group.
characteristic 
array[json] 
Identifies traits whose presence or absence is shared by members of the group  
The `text` attribute on the `valueCodeableConcept` for each `characteristic` represents responsibilities held by the Group (in Canvas a Team). Responsibilities may not be shared by more than one team.
If a group of practitioners is created/updated with a responsibility that another group is assigned, the endpoint will return an error dictating the responsibilities have already been assigned.

### 
Describes the event of a patient being administered a vaccine or a record of an immunization as reported by a patient, a clinician or another party.  
<http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-immunization.html>  
In Canvas, Immunization records are recorded using either the [Immunization Statement Commmand](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/1379672479-command-immunization-statement) or the [Immunize Command](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/4155771468-command-immunize).
### Endpoints
post /Immunization get /Immunization/{id} put /Immunization/{id} get /Immunization
post
/Immunization
#### Immunization create
Immunization records created through this endpoint will be stored in an Immunization Statement command on the patient's chart. There currently is no support to create an Immunize command with this endpoint.
### Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
extension 
array[json] 
Canvas supports a note identifier extension on this resource. The note identifier can be used with the [Canvas Note API](/api/note).
Canvas recommends sending the note identifier extension or the Encounter reference, but not both. If both are supplied, they must both refer to the same note. If neither is specified, it will insert into a Data Import note where the DOS is the current time of ingestion.

----- BEGIN PAGE https://docs.canvasmedical.com/api/letter/
This API allows customers to create letters. The effect of creating a letter is the same as creating a letter in the user interface. Content can be added using HTML & CSS. Placeholders created in Canvas will not be respected.
##  Authentication 
The Letter API uses the existing Canvas OAuth authentication flow, so you can simply post to the existing auth token endpoint /auth/token/
This endpoint was built as an addition to the Note API and uses the user/Note.write scope. This scope will not be in OAuth applications that were created prior to the release of the Note API. To get access:
  - Create a new [OAuth application](/api/customer-authentication)
  - Ask Canvas to add the new scopes to an existing OAuth application
![description](/assets/images/allowed-scopes.png)
    ```python
    import requests
    url = "https://<your-instance>.canvasmedical.com/auth/token/"
    payload = 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=canvas&client_secret=canvas'
    headers = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    }
    response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
    print(response.text)
    ```
Then use your token in the request headers as you do with the FHIR API:
![description](/assets/images/note-api-token.png)
##  Create 
To create a Note resource, POST to `https://<your-instance>.canvasmedical.com/core/api/letter/v1/Letter` using the supported attributes below. Letters will be staged on the patient's chart to then be faxed or printed. Further edits can be made in the UI as needed.
###  Attributes 
**`patientKey` (req)** text  
The unique key of the Patient for which this letter is written.
* * *
**`providerKey` (req)** text  
The unique key of the Provider staff who is responsible for the letter.
* * *
**`practiceLocationKey` (req)** text  
The unique key of the PracticeLocation for which this letter is written.
* * *
**`content`**  
The contents of the letter. Supports HTML & CSS. **Placeholders created in Canvas will NOT be respected.**
###  Example 
    ```python
    import requests
    import json
    url = "https://<your-instance>.canvasmedical.com/core/api/letter/v1/Letter"
    payload = json.dumps({
      "patientKey": "8d84776879de49518a4bc3bb81d96dd4",
      "providerKey": "5eede137ecfe4124b8b773040e33be14",
      "practiceLocationKey": "c67e0c59-d4d2-428c-bc13-b6e85d181ad0",
      "content": "<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p><p>Letty Letters is a patient of mine at PRACTICE NAME. Due to a current medical condition, the patient is unable to fulfill the requirements for jury duty.</p><p>Thanks,</p></div><div class=\"signature\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Zhu_Zhengting_signature.jpg/1280px-Zhu_Zhengting_signature.jpg\" alt=\"Signature\" width=\"200\"></div></div></html>"
    })
    headers = {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer HqFtbSnBNX4S65VhRrg8sRxO6XcSFp',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
    print(response.text)

### 
A photo, video, or audio recording acquired or used in healthcare.  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/media.html>  
FHIR Media maps to a [Visual Exam Finding Command](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/4119751144-command-visual-exam-finding) in Canvas.
### Endpoints
post /Media get /Media/{id} get /Media

### Attributes
resourceType

extension 
array[json] 
Canvas supports a note identifier extension on this resource. The note identifier can be used with the [Canvas Note API](/api/note).
Canvas recommends sending the note identifier extension or the Encounter reference, but not both. If both are supplied, they must both refer to the same note. If neither is specified, it will insert into a Data Import note where the DOS is the current time of ingestion.

### 
This resource is primarily used for the identification and definition of a medication for the purposes of prescribing, dispensing, and administering a medication as well as for making statements about medication use.  
<http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-medication.html>  
Best practice is to utilize this endpoint to find codings to feed the [Medication Statement Create/Update](/api/medicationstatement/#create). These medications come directly from our integration with FDB.
### Endpoints
get /Medication/{id} get /Medication
get
/Medication/{id}
#### Medication read
Read a Medication resource.
### Path Parameters
id required
string 
The unique identifier for the Medication   
### Response Payload Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
id 
string 
The identifier of the Medication.
text 
json 
Text summary of the Medication, for human interpretation.
Click to view child attributes
status

#### Medication search
Search for Medication resources.
### Query Parameters
**A Medication Search requires either a code or _text search parameter to perform.**
_text 
string 
Performs a case insensitive partial search on the narrative of the Medication.
code 
System url and code that identifies the medication formatted like   
`system_url|code`.  
Currently a search for an RxNorm code will return both branded and generic medications associated with the RxNorm code regardless of whether the RxNorm code is branded or generic.  
For example, a search for the RxNorm code that represents the branded version of metformin will return a search bundle that contains at least two Medication resources – one for the branded version and one for the generic version. The branded and generic Medication resources in the search bundle can be differentiated by the presence or absence of the RxNorm code for the branded version in the list of codings.
**Search Values Supported:**
  - http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm|code
### Response Payload Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
type 
string

### 
An order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for administration of the medication to a patient. The resource is called "MedicationRequest" rather than "MedicationPrescription" or "MedicationOrder" to generalize the use across inpatient and outpatient settings, including care plans, etc., and to harmonize with workflow patterns.  
<http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-medicationrequest.html>  
FHIR MedicationRequest maps to the [Prescribe, Refill, Adjust Prescription, Deny Refill, Approve Refill](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/5128727084-managing-medication-commands) commands in Canvas.

### 
A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient. A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future. The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician. A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay. The medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle, or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/medicationstatement.html>  
MedicationStatement resources can be created in two ways in the Canvas UI:
  - [Prescribe commands](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/5128727084-managing-medication-commands#prescribe-command-7) create [MedicationRequest](/api/medicationrequest/) resources, but these `Prescribe` commands are also represented as MedicationStatement resources. MedicationStatement resources that were created with a `Prescribe` command will contain a reference to the related MedicationRequest resource in the `derivedFrom` attribute.
  - MedicationStatement resources can also be created with the [Medication Statement command](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/5128727084-managing-medication-commands#medication-statement-command-1)
### Endpoints
post /MedicationStatement get /MedicationStatement/{id} put /MedicationStatement/{id} get /MedicationStatement
post
/MedicationStatement
#### MedicationStatement create
Create a MedicationStatement resource.  
If `context` or `extension` is provided, the MedicationStatement will be added to the existing encounter (note). If it is not provided, a new data import note will be created.  
Create requests support either `medicationReference` or `medicationCodeableConcept` in the request body; Canvas recommends using `medicationReference`. Medication identifiers for `medicationReference` can be obtained from the [Medication search endpoint](/api/medication/#search).
### Attributes
extension 
array[json] 
Canvas supports a note identifier extension on this resource. The note identifier can be used with the [Canvas Note API](/api/note).
Canvas recommends sending the note identifier extension or the Encounter reference, but not both. If both are supplied, they must both refer to the same note. If neither is specified, it will insert into a Data Import note where the DOS is the current time of ingestion.

----- BEGIN PAGE https://docs.canvasmedical.com/api/note/
This API allows customers to create and update notes. The effect of creating a note is the same as creating a note in the user interface (for example for a note with category "encounter" will create an encounter, a note that is billable will create a claim). Not all note attributes can be modified on update. For example, note type cannot be changed after note creation.
##  Authentication 
The Note API uses the existing OAuth authentication flow from the FHIR API, so you can simply post to the existing auth token endpoint /auth/token/
New scopes are introduced: user/Note.read and user/Note.write. These scopes will not be in OAuth applications that were created prior to the release of this feature. Therefore to get access, you have two options:
  - Create a new [OAuth application](/api/customer-authentication)
  - Ask Canvas to add the new scopes to an existing OAuth application
![description](/assets/images/allowed-scopes.png)
    ```python
    import requests
    url = "https://<your-instance>.canvasmedical.com/auth/token/"
    payload = 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=canvas&client_secret=canvas'
    headers = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    }
    response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
    print(response.text)
    ```
Then use your token in the request headers as you do with the FHIR API:

The following USCDI data elements are retrievable from this endpoint:  
  - Laboratory Tests
  - Laboratory Values/Results
  - Smoking Status
Here are some Canvas specific workflows where observations will be created:
  1. Documenting Vitals via our [Vital Command](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/9426091672-command-vitals) (category coding will be `vital-signs`)  
  2. Submitting a Questionnaire, Review Of System (ROS), Structured Assessment (SA), or a Physical Exam will result in an observation for each question answered if the question's code system is LOINC or SNOMED (category coding will be `social-history`).   
  3. There is a specific Physical Exam to capture Pediatric Vitals. Upon submission of the Exam, associated observations for Body Length, Head Circumference, and Head Occipital-Frontal Circumference Percentile (category coding will be `vital-signs`) will be created along with the observations for the answers of the exam (category coding will be `social-history`). Please contact Customer Support for help loading this Exam into your instance if you want to utilize it.   
  4. Once weight and either height or pediatric body length is entered on a patients chart, the vital observations of BMI for Age Percentile (for patients 2 years or older) and Weight-for-Length Percentile will be calculated (category coding will be `vital-signs`).
  5. Submitting a Questionnaire that has custom scoring defined will result in an observation containing the scored value (category coding will be `survey`).   
  6. When a lab report is created in Canvas through [DI](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/1652834476-labs-lab-reports), API, integration with HG, or [POC Lab Test Command](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/7060961677-point-of-care-poc-tests), there will be resulting Observations made (category coding will be `laboratory`).

### Endpoints

/Observation
#### Observation create
Although the observation endpoint houses many different Canvas models, currently, **only vital signs and panels can be created through this endpoint**.  
**Vital signs and Vital Sign Panels**  
See this [helpful guide](/guides/submit-vitals-via-fhir/) to walk you through creating a vital panel via FHIR.  
  - Vital sign panels and vital signs are both observations.  
    - Vital sign panels are the parent that "contain" the vital sign observations. The `hasMembers` attribute contains references to the child observations  
    - Each vital sign that is part of the panel links back to the parent Observation via the `derivedFrom` attribute.  
    - If a `derivedFrom` value is not included for a vital sign observation, then a new vital sign panel observation is created and will autofill the `derivedFrom` attribute field.  
  - Vital signs and their parent panel feed into our [Vitals command](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/9426091672-command-vitals).  
**Note types**  
Most our FHIR endpoints insert commands into a Data Import Note type on the patient's timeline. With the release of [configurable note types](https://help.canvasmedical.com/articles/6785045644-appointment-event-note-types), if you create a new Note Type in Settings with **system = Canvas** and **code = VitalsImport** , then the Observation Create endpoint will always import into that note type instead.  
**Supported vital sign codes used in create**
vital sign | LOINC code | default unit | additional accepted units  
---|---|---|---  
vital sign panel | 85353-1 |  |   
blood pressure | 85354-9 | mmHg |   
weight | 29463-7 | oz | lb, kg  
height | 8302-2 | in | cm  
pulse rate | 8867-4 | bpm |   
body temperature | 8310-5 | °F |   
oxygen saturation (arterial)* | 2708-6 | % |   
oxygen saturation* | 59408-5 | % |   
respiration rate | 9279-1 | bpm |   
waist circumference | 56086-2 | cm | in  
note | 80339-5 |  |   
pulse rhythm | 8884-9 |  |   
*If an oxygen saturation vital sign is created, an oxygen saturation (arterial) vital sign code is also automatically generated.

hasMember 
array[json] 
Related Observation reference(s) that belongs to the Observation group/panel.  
Only need to supply this attribute in a Vital Sign Panel to specify specific child observations that are a part of the panel. In Canvas these will form the Vitals Command. This observation IDs can be found using the [Observation Search](/api/observation/#search).   
If a new vital sign panel is created and links pre-existing vital signs via the `hasMember` attribute, those linked observations will update their `derivedFrom` attribute to be set to the newly created vital sign panel.
Click to view child attributes

display 
string 
The coding display of the reference.
derivedFrom 
array[json] 
Related Observation resource that the Observation is made from.  
This attribute should only be used to link a vital sign to an existing "parent" vital sign panel. It ingests a reference to the vital sign panel's observation. This observation ID can be found using the [Observation Search](/api/observation/#search).  
If this field is omitted on a vital sign observation, a vital sign panel will automatically be created.   
It is important to note that each vital sign panel can only contain a single vital sign of each type. Adding a duplicate of a vital sign will result in a 422 error: "Vital sign reading already exists for the given reading".

type 
string 
Type the reference refers to (e.g. "Observation", "QuestionnaireResponse").
component 
array[json] 
Component results  
This attribute is only used for blood pressure, as it has two components (systolic and diastolic).   
  - These components are added to a vital sign observation by including their `code` and `valueQuantity`.
  - The components are what will be stored in the database; however, they will not display on the UI. The `Observation.valueString` will be the attribute that displays on the UI.

Most endpoints that perform search operations support pagination. For these endpoints, search results are paginated by default, with a `links` section as defined [by FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#paging). The links include urls for `self`, `first`, `next`, and `last` as needed for the searchset. Clients that want all results will need to make use of these links to page through the data. Pagination links will not be provided for an empty result set. A tip when traversing through the pages, if a `next` relation is not in the links list, you are on the last page!
There is a maximum page size (`_count`) that is enforced by the server. This value is at 100 at the time of writing, but can change without warning. Clients must use the links in a search bundle to paginate after an initial search request is sent. When no count is specified in a search, it will default to 10.
In this example, `entry` contains 10 Observation resources - following the relative link marked as `next` returns the remaining 9.
    ```json
    {
        "resourceType": "Bundle",
        "type": "searchset",
        "total": 19,

### Endpoints
post /Patient get /Patient/{id} put /Patient/{id} get /Patient
post
/Patient
#### Patient create
Upon successful creation, the Patient identifier can be found in the `Location` header of the response. The patient record in Canvas can be viewed at _https:// <instance>.canvasmedical.com/patient/<id>_.   
Most of the fields that are populated through this endpoint will display and be editable on the Patient profile page.
### Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
id 
string 
Unique Canvas identifier for this resource
text 
json 
A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource.
extension 
array[json] 
Reference the information at the top of this page to see the possible extensions contained in this resource. Please note that the `birthsex` extension is required.
identifier 
array[json] 
The identifier list defines additional identifiers that are able to be stored for a patient. None of these identifiers will be surfaced on the Patient's chart but may help you to identify the patient in your internal system.
Click to view child attributes
use 
string 
Supported values are **usual** , **official** , **temp** , **secondary** and **old**. If omittted, the default value is **usual**.
system 
string 
Free text field to identify what this value represents.
value 
string 
Free text field to store the patient's identifier.
period 
date 
This is used to specify the start and end dates (format YYYY-MM-DD). If period is omitted it will default to `start` = 1970-01-01 and `end` = 2100-12-31. There is currently no validation if the end date is before the start date.
active 
boolean 
A boolean to specify if the patient is active in the healthcare system. If this value is not set, Canvas will default this to true.
name 
array[json] required
A name associated with the patient. Name is a `required` list of objects.  
One iteration must be marked with `use`: `official`. The first object with `use`: `official` will determine the patient's first, last, prefix, suffix or middle name. The first and last name is required within Canvas. For example:   
• the `family` attribute will populate the patient's last name.   
• the `given` list will populate the patient's first/middle name. The first item in the list will be the first name, while if more items in the list exists, it will populate the patient's middle name and be joined together with an empty space.   
• the `prefix` list will be stored within Canvas's database but will not be displayed in the Canvas UI.  
• the `suffix` list will populate the patient's suffix   
The example also demonstrates that Canvas ingests a nickname (preferred name) for the Patient. This element is identified by `use = nickname` and the first item in the given list will be the Patient's nickname. Canvas can also ingest old names or maiden names using `use`: `maiden` or `use`: `old`. These will not show up on the Canvas UI but will be stored by Canvas and will be returned via a read request.  
In the Canvas UI, each patient will be displayed as `first-last-suffix (nickname)`. Searches can be performed using first, middle, last, suffix or nickname.  
If there are any other objects defined in the name list they will be ignored.

Click to view child attributes
id 
string 
extension 
array 
This is an optional object that you can specify for a Patient's phone number or email. This tells Canvas that the patient has consented to receiving text messages or emails to this contact point. This extension is identified with the `url` <https://help.canvasmedical.com/articles/8144965836-manging-patient-consents>. A boolean value can be specified in the `valueBoolean` attribute.  
**Note:** This will not send a verification email or text as is the Canvas UI does. It will bypass this step and mark the contact as verified.
Click to view child attributes
url 
string 
valueBoolean 
boolean 
system 
string 
Supported values are **phone** , **fax** , **email** , **pager** , **url** , **sms** , and **other**. If omitted, the default value is **other**.

string 
Supported values are **home** , **work** , **temp** , **old** and **mobile**. If omitted, the default value is **home**.
rank 
integer 
An integer representing the preferred order of contact points per system. The default value is 1.
gender 
string required
The gender attribute is an optional string enum value that maps to our gender identity attribute on our UI. Currently Canvas accepts the following FHIR values: male, female, other, and unknown.   
If `unknown` is entered at the time of creation, the patient chart will show gender as 'choose not to disclose'. If `other` is selected, the patient chart will display `Additional gender category or other, please specify` in the gender field.
birthDate 
date required
The birthDate field is required in Canvas for a patient. This is a string date format that is defined here. For Canvas it is best to get the format YYYY-MM-DD. If only a month and year is given, the birthdate is set to the 1st of the given month by default. If only a year is given, the birthdate defaults to January 1st of that year. To summarize, Canvas accepts the following formats: YYYY, YYYY-MM, and YYYY-MM-DD.
deceasedDateTime 
datetime 
Indicates the decease date of the individual.  
If this value is not available, `deceasedBoolean` will be provided instead.
deceasedBoolean

### Response Payload Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
id 
string 
Unique Canvas identifier for this resource
text 
json 
A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource.
extension 
array[json] 
Reference the information at the top of this page to see the possible extensions contained in this resource. Please note that the `birthsex` extension is required.
identifier 
array[json] 
The identifier list defines additional identifiers that are able to be stored for a patient.
Click to view child attributes
use 
string 
Supported values are **usual** , **official** , **temp** , **secondary** and **old**. If omittted, the default value is **usual**.
system 
string 
Free text field to identify what this value represents.
value 
string 
Free text field to store the patient's identifier.
period 
date 
This is used to specify the start and end dates (format YYYY-MM-DD). If period is omitted it will default to `start` = 1970-01-01 and `end` = 2100-12-31. There is currently no validation if the end date is before the start date.
active 
boolean 
A boolean to specify if the patient is active in the healthcare system. If this value is not set, Canvas will default this to true.
name 
array[json] 
A name associated with the patient. Name is a `required` list of objects.  
One iteration must be marked with `use`: `official`. The first object with `use`: `official` will determine the patient's first, last, prefix, suffix or middle name. The first and last name is required within Canvas. For example:   
• the `family` attribute will populate the patient's last name.   
• the `given` list will populate the patient's first/middle name. The first item in the list will be the first name, while if more items in the list exists, it will populate the patient's middle name and be joined together with an empty space.   
• the `prefix` list will be stored within Canvas's database but will not be displayed in the Canvas UI.  
• the `suffix` list will populate the patient's suffix   
The example also demonstrates that Canvas ingests a nickname (preferred name) for the Patient. This element is identified by `use = nickname` and the first item in the given list will be the Patient's nickname. Canvas can also ingest old names or maiden names using `use`: `maiden` or `use`: `old`. These will not show up on the Canvas UI but will be stored by Canvas and will be returned via a read request.  
In the Canvas UI, each patient will be displayed as `first-last-suffix (nickname)`. Searches can be performed using first, middle, last, suffix or nickname.  
If there are any other objects defined in the name list they will be ignored.

put
/Patient/{id}
#### Patient update
**How updates/deletions to the identifier, telecom, address, and contact fields are handled:**  
Patient Search/Read will include an `id` value for these fields.  
If the `id` field is included in the iteration, then Canvas will attempt to match to an existing value for that field.  
If the `id` field is **not** included in the iteration, then Canvas will attempt to create a new entry in the database for that field.  
If a `telecom`, `address`, or `contact` iteration returned via Search/Read is **not** included in the Update message, then it will be deleted. The same delete behaviour occurs with `preferred-pharmacy`, `default-provider` and `default-location` extensions - their respective values get dropped from the Canvas if those extensions are not present during update.   
**Other Fields**  
If a field is required according to Patient Create, it is also required in the update. If the field is not required and is not added to the update request, the saved data will not be changed.
### Attributes

identifier 
array[json] 
The identifier list defines additional identifiers that are able to be stored for a patient. None of these identifiers will be surfaced on the Patient's chart but may help you to identify the patient in your internal system. If an `identifier` already exists in the Canvas database and is not included in the Update message, it will be deleted if and only if the period.end date is in the future.

boolean 
A boolean to specify if the patient is active in the healthcare system. If this value is not set, Canvas will default this to true.
name 
array[json] required
A name associated with the patient. Name is a `required` list of objects.  
One iteration must be marked with `use`: `official`. The first object with `use`: `official` will determine the patient's first, last, prefix, suffix or middle name. The first and last name is required within Canvas. For example:   
• the `family` attribute will populate the patient's last name.   
• the `given` list will populate the patient's first/middle name. The first item in the list will be the first name, while if more items in the list exists, it will populate the patient's middle name and be joined together with an empty space.   
• the `prefix` list will be stored within Canvas's database but will not be displayed in the Canvas UI.  
• the `suffix` list will populate the patient's suffix   
The example also demonstrates that Canvas ingests a nickname (preferred name) for the Patient. This element is identified by `use = nickname` and the first item in the given list will be the Patient's nickname. Canvas can also ingest old names or maiden names using `use`: `maiden` or `use`: `old`. These will not show up on the Canvas UI but will be stored by Canvas and will be returned via a read request.  
In the Canvas UI, each patient will be displayed as `first-last-suffix (nickname)`. Searches can be performed using first, middle, last, suffix or nickname.  
If there are any other objects defined in the name list they will be ignored.

gender 
string required
The gender attribute is an optional string enum value that maps to our gender identity attribute on our UI. Currently Canvas accepts the following FHIR values: male, female, other, and unknown.   
If `unknown` is entered at the time of creation, the patient chart will show gender as 'choose not to disclose'. If `other` is selected, the patient chart will display `Additional gender category or other, please specify` in the gender field.
birthDate 
date required
The birthDate field is required in Canvas for a patient. This is a string date format that is defined here. For Canvas it is best to get the format YYYY-MM-DD. If only a month and year is given, the birthdate is set to the 1st of the given month by default. If only a year is given, the birthdate defaults to January 1st of that year. To summarize, Canvas accepts the following formats: YYYY, YYYY-MM, and YYYY-MM-DD.

A name associated with the patient. Name is a `required` list of objects.  
One iteration must be marked with `use`: `official`. The first object with `use`: `official` will determine the patient's first, last, prefix, suffix or middle name. The first and last name is required within Canvas. For example:   
• the `family` attribute will populate the patient's last name.   
• the `given` list will populate the patient's first/middle name. The first item in the list will be the first name, while if more items in the list exists, it will populate the patient's middle name and be joined together with an empty space.   
• the `prefix` list will be stored within Canvas's database but will not be displayed in the Canvas UI.  
• the `suffix` list will populate the patient's suffix   
The example also demonstrates that Canvas ingests a nickname (preferred name) for the Patient. This element is identified by `use = nickname` and the first item in the given list will be the Patient's nickname. Canvas can also ingest old names or maiden names using `use`: `maiden` or `use`: `old`. These will not show up on the Canvas UI but will be stored by Canvas and will be returned via a read request.  
In the Canvas UI, each patient will be displayed as `first-last-suffix (nickname)`. Searches can be performed using first, middle, last, suffix or nickname.  
If there are any other objects defined in the name list they will be ignored.

### 
This resource provides the status of the payment for goods and services rendered, and the request and response resource references.  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/paymentnotice.html>  
In Canvas, FHIR PaymentNotice records payments made toward a patient's balance.  
See this [Zendesk article](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/3813109228-collect-payment) for information about how to collect payments.
### Endpoints
post /PaymentNotice get /PaymentNotice/{id} get /PaymentNotice
post
/PaymentNotice
#### PaymentNotice create
Create a PaymentNotice resource.  
This endpoint can be used to note a payment that has been collected from a patient and deduct the amount from their balance.  
Moreover, this endpoint can be used to denote copayments as well. For that purpose, use the valueReference extension to link the associated Claim for which the copayment is being processed. Adding that extension determines the purpose of action for this endpoint, meaning that it would be treated as a copayment transaction if the Claim reference extension is present.  
**Don't overpay!** Requests that would bring the account balance negative will be rejected. Example: If a patient owes $5, Canvas would reject a PaymentNotice with a value that is greater than $5. Balance can only go negative if performing copayments as customers could be charged prior to recieveing a medical service.  
A created payment notice can be found in Canvas by going to the patient's chart, and clicking the paper icon in the top right corner. The created payment notice will be displayed under receipts. The "Originator" will be automatically set to Canvas Bot.  
As payment notices are created, they will be applied to charges in chronological order of creation date, from oldest to newest.
### Attributes
extension 
array[json] 
Specific FHIR extensions on resources are supported to be able to map some Canvas specific attributes. The copayment extensions contains references to claims used for copayments.
If you are not denoting a copayment, then use PaymentNotice without the copayment extension for other type of payments.

### 
Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource. Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.  
<http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-provenance.html>   
In Canvas a Provenance record is created each time the following data types are create or updated in the Canvas database:
  - AllergyIntolerance
  - CarePlan
  - CareTeamMembership
  - Condition
  - ConsolidatedImmunization
  - Coverage
  - Device
  - DiagnosticReport
  - DocumentReference
  - Encounter
  - Goal
  - Observation
  - Patient
  - Prescription
  - Procedure
  - ServiceRequest
  - UpdateGoal

### 
A structured set of questions intended to guide the collection of answers from end-users. Questionnaires provide detailed control over order, presentation, phraseology and grouping to allow coherent, consistent data collection.  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/questionnaire.html>  
See our [article](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/7017593857-creating-questionnaires) for information about how to create and upload a questionnaire in Canvas.  
**Understanding Canvas Questionnaires**  
_Codings_  
All questionnaires must have coding, and all response options within a question on a questionnaire must have codings.  
_Question Types_  
Canvas supports 3 different type of questions:  
1\. Multi select response questions are denoted with:  
`"type": "choice", "repeats": true`  
2\. Single select response questions are denoted with:  
`"type": "choice", "repeats": false`  
3\. Free text response questions are denoted with:  
`"type": "text", "repeats": false`  
Questions can be reused in multiple questionnaires, but any given question code should only appear once within a particular questionnaire.
### Endpoints

### 
A structured set of questions and their answers. The questions are ordered and grouped into coherent subsets, corresponding to the structure of the grouping of the questionnaire being responded to.  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/questionnaireresponse.html>  
See this [article](https://help.canvasmedical.com/articles/7017593857-creating-questionnaires) for information about how to build questionnaires in Canvas.  
Questionnaires can map to four different commands in the Canvas UI depending on what the use case in charting is set to:
  - [Questionnaire](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/5651999344-command-questionnaire)
  - [Structured Assessment](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/8805008571-command-structured-assessment)
  - [Review of Systems](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/9046024531-command-review-of-systems)
  - [Physical Exam](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/1745103290-command-physical-exam)
QuestionnaireResponse resources contain answers to questions in a Questionnaire resource. Use the [Questionnaire search endpoint](/api/questionnaire/#search) to find Questionnaire resources.
### Endpoints
post /QuestionnaireResponse get /QuestionnaireResponse/{id} put /QuestionnaireResponse/{id} get /QuestionnaireResponse
post
/QuestionnaireResponse
#### QuestionnaireResponse create
Create an QuestionnaireResponse resource.
### Attributes
resourceType 
string 
The FHIR Resource name.
extension 
array[json] 
Additional content defined by implementations  
Canvas supports a note identifier extension on this resource for create, read, update, and search interactions. The note identifier can be used with the [Canvas Note API](/api/note).  
**Important:** For create interactions, Canvas recommends sending the note identifier extension or the Encounter reference, but not both. If both are supplied, they must both refer to the same note.

item 
array[json] 
Groups and questions  
The `item` attribute contains the answers to the questions in the Questionnaire. The `item` attribute in QuestionnaireResponse corresponds to the `item` attribute in Questionnaire payload, and are related via the `linkId` attribute. If a question's answer is omitted, it will be left unanswered in Canvas. However, if it is a questionnaire tied to a scoring function, Canvas requires all questions to be answered in order to accurately score the Questionnaire.  
Each `item` must contain a `linkId` and `answer` attributes. The `answer` attribute is a list of answers for the question referred to by the `linkId`.  
Canvas supports the following question formats:  
• Free text  
• Single choice  
• Multiple choice  
Answers to free text questions are provided as a `valueString`. Answers to single and multiple choice questions are provided as a `valueCoding`. See the request and response examples for more information.  
The following mappings show how the FHIR system URI is mapped to the Canvas system (FHIR -> Canvas):

### Responses
201 Created 
The server has successfully processed the request; the new resource has been created and is now ready for interaction.  
Canvas returns the created resource's id as a UUID within the `location` header and a `null` response body. 
### Errors
400 Bad Request 
The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. An accompanying error message will explain further. 
401 Unauthorized 
The request requires user authentication. 
403 Forbidden 
The request requires user authorization. 
405 Method Not Allowed 
The request performs an operation that is either not supported or allowed. 
422 Unprocessable Entity 
The request cannot be processed due to semantic issues or conflicts with the database state. 
**Validation Errors**  
_Beware of ambiguous choices!_  
If the questionnaire contains a question with identical codings for different choices, Canvas will not know which of the choices were selected. In this case, Canvas will reject the request. For the request to succeed, each question must have a uniquely coded set of choices. Choice codings can be reused across questions, but not within them.If this scenario occurs, you will get the error message: `Question received a response option code: {code} that belongs to more than one option response`  
_More Coding Validation_  
The system is the `valueCoding` answer needs to match the system that the question specified in the Questionnaire Search Response. If it does not, you will get the error: `Question expects answer of code system {system} but {system} was given`  
If a code is passed that does not exist for that question in Canvas, you will get the error: `Question received an invalid response option code: {code}`  
_Answer Validation_  
For single or free text questions, if more than one answer is provided, you will get the error: `Question of type {type} is expecting at most one answer`  
For free text questions, the answer object must include a `valueString` or you will get the error: `Question of type TXT expects a valueString answer`  
For single or multiple choice questions, the answer objects must include a `valueCoding` or you will see one of these errors:  
`Question of type SING expects a valueCoding answer`  
`Question of type MULT expects a valueCoding answer`

item 
array[json] 
Groups and questions  
The `item` attribute contains the answers to the questions in the Questionnaire. The `item` attribute in QuestionnaireResponse corresponds to the `item` attribute in Questionnaire payload, and are related via the `linkId` attribute. If a question's answer is omitted, it will be left unanswered in Canvas. However, if it is a questionnaire tied to a scoring function, Canvas requires all questions to be answered in order to accurately score the Questionnaire.  
Each `item` must contain a `linkId` and `answer` attributes. The `answer` attribute is a list of answers for the question referred to by the `linkId`.  
Canvas supports the following question formats:  
• Free text  
• Single choice  
• Multiple choice  
Answers to free text questions are provided as a `valueString`. Answers to single and multiple choice questions are provided as a `valueCoding`. See the request and response examples for more information.

##  Authentication 
To access our FHIR API, you will need to request an access token and refresh it periodically. You can refer to our [Authentication Documentation](/api/customer-authentication) and [Authentication Best Practices](/api/authentication-best-practices) to get you set up. Access tokens expire 10 hours after they are created. You can and should reuse access tokens to reduce the number of tokens that are valid at any given time.
##  Create a patient 
Let's start by creating a patient. we've gone ahead and generated some boilerplate Patient info that includes all of the minimum required parameters for a Create a Patient request.
    ```shell
    curl -i --location 'https://fumage-<sandbox-name>.canvasmedical.com/Patient' \
         --header 'Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>' \
         --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         --data '{
            "resourceType": "Patient",
            "extension": [
                {
                    "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-birthsex",
                    "valueCode": "F"
                }
            ],
            "gender": "female",
            "active": true,
            "name": [
                {
                    "use": "official",
                    "family": "Mitko",
                    "given": [
                        "Salina"
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "birthDate": "1949-11-13"
        }'
    ```
To execute this command, first:
Replace  with your sandbox name Replace  with your Bearer token you learned about above in the Authentication Section Hit enter and your first patient, Salina Mitko, is created!
Navigate to the Canvas UI (sandbox or production instance) and log in using the credentials provided, search for Salina in the top-left search box and visit the first search result to find her chart.
For more detail about making Patient Create requests, check out the API documentation for Patient Create.
> **Info:** As part of the request's response, you will see a patient ID within the location: header. Copy the ID value between Patient/ and / history - you will need it to create an appointment in the next step.  
>   
>  Also to note that ID will match the ID you will find in your browser when you navigate to the patient's chat: https://{customer}.canvasmedication.com/patient/{patientID} 
##  Create an Appointment 
We have our first patient and now want to book their first appointment. But before we can book their appointment we will need to find a practitioner.
If you are using one of our canvas sandboxes, there will already be a demo staff member loaded in the instance.
Run the following request to find the list of Practitioners in your organization. Again you will need to replace the  and  with the same values you used to create your patient above.
    ```shell
    curl --location 'https://fumage-<sandbox-name>.canvasmedical.com/Practitioner' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/fhir+json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>' | jq
    ```
You will then get a response similar to:
    ```shell
    {
      "resourceType" : "Bundle",
      "type" : "searchset",
      "total" : 1,
      "entry" : [
        {
          "resource" : {
            "resourceType" : "Practitioner",
            "id" : "e766816672f34a5b866771c773e38f3c",
            "identifier" : [
              {
                "system" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi",
                "value" : "1834494258"
              }
            ],
            "name" : [
              {
                "use" : "usual",
                "text" : "Youta Priti MD",
                "family" : "Priti",
                "given" : [
                  "Youta"
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        }
       }
      ]
    }
    ```
Copy down the value for "id". This is the Practitioner ID you will need to create your first appointment.
Now we have our Patient ID and Practitioner ID. We're ready to create our first appointment.
Now lets set up the cURL command to create the appointment. Again you will need to replace the  and . Then replace  and  with the values copied in the last two requests. This appointment will create a Telehealth Appointment. You might want to update the start and end dates to be today's date for easy find-ability on the calendar view.
    ```shell
    curl -i --location 'https://fumage-<sandbox-name>.canvasmedical.com/Appointment' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "resource": {
            "resourceType": "Appointment",
            "status": "booked",
            "appointmentType": {
                "coding": [
                    {
                        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
                        "code": "448337001",
                        "display": "Telemedicine consultation with patient (procedure)"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "description": "Weekly check-in.",
            "supportingInformation" : [
              {
                "reference" : "Location/1"
              }
            ],
            "start": "2022-02-19T13:30:00.000Z",
            "end": "2022-02-19T14:00:00.000Z",
            "participant": [
                {
                    "actor": {
                        "reference": "Practitioner/<practitioner-id>"
                    },
                    "status": "accepted"
                },
                {
                    "actor": {
                        "reference": "Patient/<patient-id>"
                    },
                    "status": "accepted"
                }
            ]
        }
    }'
    ```
If you navigate to the correct date you used for start and end in the request above on the Schedule of your Canvas home page, you will see your first appointment. You should also be able to see the appointment when navigating to the patient's chart.

### 
A request for a service to be performed for a patient, such as imaging, laboratory testing, or referral.  
<https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-servicerequest.html>  
ServiceRequest represents multiple Canvas services:
  - Imaging orders (e.g., CT, MRI, X-ray) - [Ordering imaging study](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/2615916315-image-command) \- Laboratory orders (e.g., hemoglobin/hematocrit) - [Placing a lab order](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/3065191197-placing-a-lab-order) \- Referrals (e.g., patient referral to specialist) - [Referring a patient](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/8339414277-command-referrals) The ServiceRequest surface reflects these orders via standardized coding:
  - `category` uses SNOMED CT to represent the order category (e.g., Imaging, Laboratory procedure, Referral/Evaluation procedure) - `code` uses LOINC to represent the requested test/procedure

Arbitration and Class Action Waiver. This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a Class Action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below. Informal Process First. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and us, you will first contact us and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action. Arbitration Agreement. Under this Agreement, you agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement your use of the Developer Tools, or relating in any way to the communications between you and us or any other user of Use will be finally resolved by confidential binding arbitration administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") in San Francisco, California, or another forum mutually agreed upon by you and us. The arbitration will be conducted according to the JAMS Expedited Procedures for arbitration by a single arbitrator nominated jointly by you and us. If JAMS is not hearing consumer commercial disputes at the time, we may select another arbitral body at its sole discretion. The arbitrator's award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude us from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction, or to seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or patents. This arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by us for infringement of our intellectual property or access to the Developer Tools that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in this Agreement or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases.
You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a Class Action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these this Agreement.
Class Action Waiver. Any Claim must be brought in the respective party's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding ("Class Action"). The parties waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.
If this Class Action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Section, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and us each waive any right to a jury trial.
Ownership. Subject to the licenses and rights specified in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement transfers or assigns to us any of your intellectual property rights in the Connected Services or your trademarks, logos, or other brand insignia nor does this Agreement transfer or assign to you any of our intellectual property rights in the Application and Developer Tools or our trademarks, logos, or other brand insignia.

Canvas' FHIR API supports the SMART launch sequence, and the Canvas SDK allows you to embed html content within the Canvas EMR. The combination of these capabilities is a frictionless experience when embedding a SMART app into Canvas. This example will show you how to register a SMART app's credentials and create an application to launch it from within a patient's chart.
##  In this guide you will learn how to: 
  - Configure credentials for a public OAuth application.
  - Create an application to initiate the SMART launch sequence.
  - Use application launch context to help form the SMART launch URL parameters.
##  What is a SMART app? 
SMART on FHIR applications adhere to a standards-based approach to authentication, authorization, and data access with the goal of being portable across EMR installations and vendors. Because SMART apps limit themselves to standards based data, the logic can be agnostic to the EMR it is running against. Vendor to vendor, site to site, FHIR is FHIR, that's how it works, right?
##  Where can I get a SMART app? 
We've provided an example SMART app [here](https://github.com/canvas-medical/example-smart-on-fhir-app). You can fork it and customize, or just use ours as-is. We use GitHub pages to host it at `https://canvas-medical.github.io/example-smart-on-fhir-app/`. Please ensure the client id [listed in `launch.html`](https://github.com/canvas-medical/example-smart-on-fhir-app/blob/205b14ed8d4f4d9c57fd11a26f9a22c800f38c29/launch.html#L15) matches the client id for the credentials you configure in the next step.
##  Configuring credentials 
The first step to embedding a SMART application is to configure OAuth credentials for it to use. Navigate to `<YOUR_CANVAS_URL>/auth/applications/register/` and choose `Public` client type, `Authorization code` grant type, the `RSA` algorithm, and set the redirect uri for your SMART application.
![OAuth Configuration](/assets/images/guides/embedding-a-smart-app/SMART_OAuth.png)
##  Creating an application 
We encourage you to read our more comprehensive guide on [creating applications via the Canvas SDK](/guides/your-first-application/), but we can provide an abridged version here.
Using the [Canvas CLI](/sdk/canvas_cli/), create an application from a template using `canvas init application`. After providing a name, the Canvas CLI will create a directory with your application inside it.
    ```bash
    dev@canvas:plugins$ canvas init application
      [1/1] project_name (My Cool Application): My Smart App
    Project created in /Users/dev/src/plugins/my_smart_app
    dev@canvas:plugins$ tree my_smart_app/
    my_smart_app/
    ├── CANVAS_MANIFEST.json
    ├── README.md
    ├── applications
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── my_application.py
    └── assets
        └── python-logo.png
    3 directories, 5 files
    ```
There are two files we'll want to visit for changes: `CANVAS_MANIFEST.json` and `applications/my_application.py`.
###  Configuring the manifest file 
In order to set the same-origin policy for the iframe our SMART app will be embedded into, we need to make sure the url where the SMART app is hosted is listed in the `url_permissions` section of the manifest, and the `ALLOW_SAME_ORIGIN` permission is requested.
    ```json
        "url_permissions": [
            {
                "url": "https://canvas-medical.github.io",
                "permissions": ["ALLOW_SAME_ORIGIN"]
            }
        ],
    ```
We also want to change the application scope from the default "global" setting to "patient specific":
    ```json
        "components": {
            "applications": [
                {
                    ...
                    "scope": "patient_specific",
                }
            ],
        },
    ```
###  Setting the SMART launch URL 
The SMART authorization dance begins with the SMART app's launch URL. The parameters present on this URL set the wheels in motion. The launch URL is loaded in an iframe, and javascript immediately reads the `iss` param in order to probe the FHIR API's CapabilityStatement for the EMR's Authorize endpoint, which the iframe is then redirected to, with its own load of URL parameters in tow.
We can set this initial URL and launch params in the `on_open` method found in `applications/my_application.py`. This is the code that is invoked when a user clicks the application's launch icon.
    ```python
    import json
    from base64 import b64encode
    from urllib.parse import urlencode
    from canvas_sdk.effects import Effect
    from canvas_sdk.effects.launch_modal import LaunchModalEffect
    from canvas_sdk.handlers.application import Application
    class MyApplication(Application):
        def on_open(self) -> Effect:
            launch_context = {
                "patient": self.context["patient"]["id"]
            }
            encoded_launch_context = b64encode(json.dumps(launch_context).encode()).decode()
            launch_params = {
                "iss": f"https://fumage-{self.environment['CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER']}.canvasmedical.com",
                "launch": encoded_launch_context
            }
            encoded_launch_params = urlencode(launch_params)
            return LaunchModalEffect(
                url=f"https://canvas-medical.github.io/example-smart-on-fhir-app/launch.html?{encoded_launch_params}",
                target=LaunchModalEffect.TargetType.RIGHT_CHART_PANE,
            ).apply()
    ```
That's all the plugin work we need to do in order to create a launcher for the SMART application. Install the plugin into your Canvas instance, navigate to a patient's chart, and choose your application from the launcher.
##  Executing the launch sequence 
Upon launching your application, the SMART app will need the user to sign off on the access token it will receive to access the FHIR API on behalf of the logged in user.
![Authorize the token](/assets/images/guides/embedding-a-smart-app/SMART_Authorize.png)
The page you're seeing in the image is served by Canvas. This page is asking for the logged in user's consent to sending the SMART app a token which can access the FHIR API on the user's behalf. Clicking `Authorize` will redirect the iframe to the URL specified in the OAuth client's configuration with several params, most critically the API access token.
With the SMART app now in possession of a valid API access token, the application can function with access to all the data it is authorized to retrieve from the FHIR API. The example SMART app we've been working with simply shows the raw FHIR records retrieved for the patient.
![SMART app in action](/assets/images/guides/embedding-a-smart-app/SMART_App.png)
If you want to update the example SMART app to authorize additional data access from the FHIR API, you'll need to add those endpoints to the `scope` values in [launch.html](https://github.com/canvas-medical/example-smart-on-fhir-app/blob/main/launch.html), or wherever your authorize method is called:
    ```html
        <script>
            FHIR.oauth2.authorize({
                ...
                // The scopes that you request from the EHR. In this case we want to:
                scope: "patient/Patient.read patient/MedicationStatement.read patient/Goal.read patient/DocumentReference.read launch offline_access openid fhirUser",
                ...
            });
        </script>
    ```
For a more comprehensive list of available FHIR scopes, visit the [API docs](https://docs.canvasmedical.com/api/).
##  A more flexible alternative 
If you're looking to provide your users a more native experience without requiring the intricate authorization dance SMART prescribes, you're already pretty close just by going through the exercise above! While we created an embedded iframe of remote-hosted content, the Canvas SDK also allows you to [define HTTP endpoints](/sdk/handlers-simple-api-http/) which can also be the targets of the iframes. This allows your plugins to host [dynamically rendered HTML](/sdk/layout-effect/#custom-html-and-django-templates), CSS, Javascript, and more, with no external hosting required! You can take advantage of the built-in [session authentication](/sdk/handlers-simple-api-http/#session) for access control (no separate logins or authorizations for your users), and you have direct access to the EMR database through the Canvas SDK's [data module](/sdk/data/). [Caching](/sdk/caching/) and [websockets](/sdk/handlers-simple-api-websocket/) help you provide modern experiences, while the [effects module](/sdk/effects/) ensures you can write new data back into Canvas as needed.
The Canvas SDK allows you to deploy full web applications within the EMR, colocating your code with the data it needs to function, and without requiring any additional infrastructure.

----- BEGIN PAGE https://docs.canvasmedical.com/guides/fhir-v2-migration-guide/
Canvas's v2 FHIR API is a from-the-ground-up rewrite of our v1 FHIR API. We have matched and exceeded the v1 API's capabilities, while providing improvements in performance, reliability, consistency, expandability, and general usability.
##  Gradual Migration 
You can control which API you use on a request-by-request basis by simply changing the subdomain. Your authentication tokens work on both versions.
##  Expected General Differences in the v2 API 
The goal in developing v2 FHIR API was not to match the behavior of the v1 API in all respects. The goal was to support all the same FHIR resource interactions and simultaneously make additional improvements in validation and FHIR standard compliance. Given that, it is expected that there will be differences between the old and new APIs.
###  Observability 
The v2 API adds a correlation ID to the headers of every response it sends. When reporting problems, please provide Canvas with the correlation ID for the failed request, as it expedites the problem resolution process. The correlation ID streamlines our investigation process by allowing Canvas to find all linked log data for that request.
###  Validation 
The v2 API performs validation of request bodies for create/update interactions that is much more extensive than the old API. Strict conformance to FHIR where possible is the goal. As a result, some fields that were not required before will be required going forward.
According to the FHIR specification, string values must be at least length 1. Empty strings may have been accepted some create or update endpoints in the previous version of Canvas's FHIR API, but the validation that the v2 API does will reject FHIR request bodies that do not conform to this.
###  Pagination 
Pagination will be turned on by default and required. It can no longer be assumed that a search-type interaction providing no search parameters will return all results in the database within a single response. Clients that want all results will need to make use of the provided links in the search bundle response to page through the data. Pagination links will not be provided for an empty result set.
There is a maximum page size that is enforced by the server. This value is at 100 at the time of writing, but can change without warning. Clients must use the links in a search bundle to paginate after an initial search request is sent.
###  OperationOutcome Responses 
There is a new validation and error handling framework in place that will provide more detailed error responses. As such, there will be significant departures from how the v1 API reports errors.
**Note:** The improvement of error handling is an ongoing effort that will continue after the v2 API is complete and the v1 API has been fully deprecated. Some error handling pathways from the v1 API will live on in v2 until they are updated.
##  Resource-specific Differences in the v2 API 
We created a diff-tool that allowed for requests sent to the v1 API to be mock-replayed in the v2 API, such that the responses from old and new can then be compared. The results of this were captured and analyzed for any differences. From there we eliminated unwanted differences and identified and explained all desired differences. The information below is the result of that analysis.
###  Appointment 
**Create/Update**
  - Canvas's v1 FHIR API supports an incorrect request body format for create and update interactions. The Appointment resource could be embedded in the request body under a key named `resource`. The v1 API supports both this incorrect format and the correct format, but v2 only supports the valid FHIR format.
  - Per FHIR, the following applies to `contained`: 
    - There must be exactly one resource, and it must be of type `Endpoint`.
    - Per FHIR, the following applies to the Endpoint resource: 
      - The `status` field is required, but is not used by Canvas. Canvas recommends sending **active**.
      - The `connectionType` field is required, but is not used by Canvas. Canvas recommends sending an empty JSON object: `{}`
      - The `payloadType` field is required, but is not used by Canvas. Canvas recommends sending: `[{"coding": []}]`
  - The `appointmentType` field must contain one coding, and it must be a SNOMED or INTERNAL coding.
  - Per FHIR, the `status` field on `participant` elements is required, but is not used by Canvas. Canvas recommends sending **active**.
**Search**
  - New parameter `status`
    - `GET /Appointment?status=proposed`
  - New parameter `appointment-type`
    - `GET /Appointment?appointment-type=http://snomed.info/sct|308335008`
  - New parameter `location`
    - `GET /Appointment?location=Location/6bf7d3a8-06c1-424f-a153-15e53b775769`
###  CareTeam 
**Update**
  - Per US Core, `status` is required (e.g. `active`).
  - Per US Core, `subject` is required. In Canvas each patient only has one care team, so CareTeam identifiers match Patient identifiers. The identifier in the subject reference must match the identifier URL. If provided, the value in id must also match the identifier in the URL.
###  CarePlan 
**Read/Search**
  - Per FHIR, `category[*].code` is a list rather than an object. Instead of returning a single object, this field will now return a list of size 1 with the same object.
###  Claim 
**Create**
  - Per FHIR, `supportingInfo` sequence must be a positive integer
  - Per FHIR, `quantity` must be a `SimpleQuantity` rather than an integer.
  - Per FHIR, `priority` is required. Canvas only accepts `normal` for `priority.coding[0].code` and `http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/process-priority` for `priority.coding[0].system`
  - Canvas previously supported identifying the `provider` by their NPI. This will no longer be supported and `provider.reference` should refer to a Practitioner reference from our Practitioner Read/Search endpoints. `provider.type` can be omitted but if valued, it should be `Practitioner`.
###  Communication 
**Create**
  - Per FHIR, `status` is a required value, and per Canvas must be set to `unknown`.
  - In the `payload`, the `content` attribute must be named `contentString`.
###  Consent 
**Create**
  - The `scope` field is required by FHIR, but is not used by Canvas. Canvas recommends sending an empty JSON object as a value: `{}`
###  Condition 
**Read**
  - Read must be performed using the resource `id` (a UUID) of the Condition. Read by database primary key was previously supported, but that support has been removed.
  - The coding system for `code` is now set to `http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm` when this code system applies; previously, the string `ICD-10` was returned.
**Search**
  - New parameter `clinical-status`
    - `GET /Condition?clinical-status=active`
  - New parameter `verification-status`
    - `GET /Condition?verification-status=entered-in-error`
###  Coverage 
**Create/Update**
  - The `resourceType` field needs to be the string `Coverage` exactly, extra quotes will not be supported (e.g. `"Coverage"`).
  - The optional fields `payor.display` and `class.value` do not accept empty strings anymore. If provided, they must contain a string at least of length 1. 
    - These were previously returned by the Read/Search endpoints though can now be expected to be empty when a value is not present.
###  CoverageEligibilityRequest 
**Create**
  - The `created` field is required by FHIR, but is not used by Canvas. Canvas recommends sending the current timestamp.
  - The `insurer` field is required by FHIR, but is not used by Canvas. Canvas recommends sending an empty JSON object as a value: `{}`
###  DiagnosticReport 
**Read/Search**
  - Previously, Canvas included a non-FHIR implementation of `id` in the `encounter`, `identifier`, `performer`, `result`, and `subject` fields. These fields have been removed.
###  DocumentReference 
**Read/Search**
  - Removed erroneous usage of `identifier.id`
  - For performance reasons, search results no longer include `url`. Read will continue to include `url`. 
    - Requesting authenticated, expiring URLs from AWS S3 requires making one API call per document. Only providing this on read requests ensures you only wait on this when you need to.
  - Previously, content format system was set to `http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-formatcodes.html`, but now it is set to `http://ihe.net/fhir/ValueSet/IHE.FormatCode.codesystem`
###  Encounter 
**Read/Search**
  - The `appointment.reference` field now has the string `Appointment/` as a prefix (so it is in the format `Appointment/{id}` instead of just `{id}`).
###  Goal 
**Read/Search**
  - The `startDate` field in the Goal resource will now be pulled from the `start_date` field on the Canvas Goal model. Previously, `startDate` was populated with `local_date_of_service` of the associated note.
###  Location 
**Read/Search**
  - Per FHIR, the `active` field is now named `status`.
###  Medication 
**Read**
  - Previously, `code.coding` repeated the RxNorm codes with display values for an internal field. This has been corrected to remove the repetitions and include the display value for the Medication.
###  MedicationRequest 
**Read/Search**
  - Per FHIR, the field `reasonCode.coding` is now a list rather than an object. This means instead of returning an object, the field will now return a list of size 1 with the same object.
  - Dispense quantity was previously sent for both `doseAndRate.doseQuantity` and `dispenseRequest.quantity`. The `doseAndRate.doseQuantity` now represents the amount of medication per dose rather than the quantity of medication units.
  - The coding system for `reasonCode` is now set to `http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm` when this code system applies; previously, the string `ICD-10` was returned.
###  Observation 
**Create**
  - Per FHIR, the `status` is required, but is not used by Canvas. Canvas recommends sending `unknown`.
  - The `status` field will always be returned with the value `entered-in-error` if the Observation data instance has a value in the `entered_in_error` field in Canvas.
  - `valueQuantity.value` must be provided as a number, not a string.
  - Vital sign observations for composite measurements such as _blood pressure_ must not use the root level `valueQuantity` field since these are instead provided as entries under the `component[*].valueQuantity` field. Blood pressure is the only observation supported by Canvas that must be sent as components.
  - For non-composite measurements such as _weight_ (and all other Canvas Vitals command measurements except blood pressure) the root level `valueQuantity` field should be used and no duplicate component valueQuantities should be included.
**Read/Search**
  - The `status` field will always be returned with the value `entered-in-error` if the Observation data instance has a value in the `entered_in_error` field in Canvas.
  - A `dataAbsentReason` entry will never be present if a valid value is provided for `valueQuantity`
  - Canvas does not make use of the `interpretation` field, so this has been removed in the interest of clarity instead of returning an explicit `unknown` entry.
  - Previously, for Observations where the `hasMember` field contained references to other Observations, the `code` field contained the codings for all of the members. Now, `code` will only contain the codings associated with the Observation itself, and will not include codings of the members.
###  Patient 
**Create/Update**
  - Per FHIR, `photo` must be a list of type `Attachment` rather than a single `Attachment`. Canvas will still only utilize the first entry.
  - Per FHIR, `gender` is a required field and must be one of the fields accepted by FHIR: (`male | female | other | unknown`)
  - Per FHIR, `telecom` field must be a list.
  - Per FHIR, `telecom[*].rank` must be an integer of value 1 or greater. 0 will no longer be accepted as a value for `telecom[*].rank`.
  - The `birthDate` field must meet FHIR's date format requirements.
  - `identifier[*].use` must now be one of (`usual | official | temp | secondary | old`) if it is provided
  - `contact[*].name` previously accepted a list. Now it conforms to the FHIR spec and no longer accepts a list.
  - Previously, the `gender` field value was the same as the stored `birthsex` value. Now the gender field value in read and search responses is extracted from the gender identity extension value if one was passed in to create or update, or the value of the gender field if the gender identity extension was not used.
  - The `birthsex` extension will now follow standard FHIR and can only be one of `(M | F | OTH | UNK | ASKU)`
  - `http://schemas.canvasmedical.com/fhir/extensions/emergency-contact`, `http://schemas.canvasmedical.com/fhir/extensions/authorized-for-release-of-information`, `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-genderIdentity`, and `http://schemas.canvasmedical.com/fhir/extensions/sexual-orientation` extensions were added.
  - Previously, omitting the `telecom`, `address`, or `contact` arrays entirely would have no effect on the database values for those fields. In the new API, omitting these fields entirely will have the same effect as sending an empty array would (i.e. removing any data currently in the database for those fields), to properly adhere to how REST APIs should handle updates.
  - The race and ethnicity extensions are now specified with this format:
    ```json
    {

        "extension": [

    ```
  - The structure of the race and ethnicity extensions is the same. Codings can be obtained from the FHIR documentation for each extension: 
    - <http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-race.html>
    - <http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-ethnicity.html>
  - The `url` value for each inner extension can be: `ombCategory` or `detailed`
  - The concept of unknown can be specified as follows: 
    - The `url` for the ValueSet should be set to `ombCategory`.
    - The `system` for the `valueCoding` should be set to `http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor`
    - The `code` for the `valueCoding` should be set to `UNK`
  - Previously, language coding systems were set to`http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/all-languages`, but now they are set to `urn:ietf:bcp:47`
**Read/Search**
  - `telecom[*].period` previously contained hardcoded values not linked to any underlying data. This has been removed.
  - There are some minor spacing differences in the values of the `text.div` field.
  - Extensions with no `valueString` values (namely `http://schemas.canvasmedical.com/fhir/extensions/clinical-note` and `http://schemas.canvasmedical.com/fhir/extensions/administrative-note extensions`) are no longer returned.
  - Previously, the `gender` field value was the same as the stored `sexAtBirth` value. Now the `gender` field value in read and search responses is extracted from the gender identity extension value if one was passed in to create or update, or the value of the gender field if the gender identity extension was not used.
  - The `birthsex` extension will now follow standard FHIR and be one of `(M | F | OTH | UNK | ASKU)`
  - `http://schemas.canvasmedical.com/fhir/extensions/emergency-contact`, `http://schemas.canvasmedical.com/fhir/extensions/authorized-for-release-of-information`, `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-genderIdentity`, and `http://schemas.canvasmedical.com/fhir/extensions/sexual-orientation` extensions were added.
**Special note regarding`telecom[*].rank`**
  - Per FHIR, `telecom[*].rank` must be a positive integer. Please note that if you have `rank` values stored in your own systems from read/search responses prior to this migration, you may see a difference between some of the `rank` values received after the migration and your stored `rank` values. This is because Canvas previously allowed and returned `rank` values of 0.
###  PaymentNotice 
**Create**
  - The `created` field is required by FHIR, but is not used by Canvas. Canvas recommends sending the current timestamp. The value returned by a read or search interaction will be the creation timestamp of the actual database record.
  - The `payment` and `recipient` fields are required by FHIR, but are not used by Canvas. Canvas recommend sending empty JSON objects as values: `{}`
###  Questionnaire 
**Search**
  - Search behavior has generally been simplified and clarified. Previously, when using search filters like `identifier`, `code`, or `name`, other search filters like `status` would be automatically and implicitly applied. Now, search results will only be filtered by what is specified by the supplied search parameters.
  - New parameter `status`
    - `GET /Questionnaire?status=active`
    - `GET /Questionnaire?status=retired`
###  QuestionnaireResponse 
**Create**
  - Per FHIR, `status` is required, and Canvas only acknowledges `completed` status. All QuestionnaireResponse messages should contain a `status` of `completed`.
  - Per FHIR, `item -> answer -> valueString`, if present, may not be an empty string. Empty text answers must be omitted.
  - Per FHIR, `item -> answer -> valueCoding -> description` must not be an empty string. Coded answers must have a non-empty display value. 
    - **Note:** in the rare case a database record already contains an empty string display value, it will be returned as the string `<no display available>` as a notification.
**Search**
  - New parameter `questionnaire.code`
    - `GET /QuestionnaireResponse?questionnaire.code=http://loinc.org|69725-0`
  - New parameter `questionnaire.item.code`
    - GET `/QuestionnaireResponse?questionnaire.item.code=http://loinc.org|69725-0`
###  Task 
**Create/Update**
  - Per FHIR, `intent` is required, and must be set to `unknown`.
  - The following incorrectly-named attributes are accepted by the old API and will be renamed in Fumage. 
    - `assignee` must be referred to as `owner`
    - `creator` must be referred to as `requester`
    - `title` must be referred to as `description`
    - `due` must be referred to as the nested value `restriction -> period -> end`
    - within a `note`, author must be referred to as `authorReference -> reference`
**Search**
  - The parameter `creator` must be referred to as `requester`.
  - The parameter `identifier` is no longer supported but should be replaced with `_id`, which is the functionality that `identifier` previously implemented
  - New parameter `label` to filter by task label 
    - `GET /Task?label=example_label`
  - New ability to sort by due date 
    - `GET /Task?_sort=due-date`
    - `GET /Task?_sort=-due-date`
  - New parameter `description` to filter on title/description 
    - `GET /Task?description=Netcare`
##  Patient Scoped Tokens 
Canvas has added support for patient scoped tokens. These are access tokens requested on behalf of a specific patient and have read/write access to that patient's records only.
To acquire a patient scoped token, you will need to include some parameters in the body of your token request:
  - A `client_id` and `client_secret` that your application will use to [authenticate with Canvas](/api/customer-authentication/).
  - The Canvas resource id for the `patient` the token will be scoped to
  - A `scope` parameter with space separated patient level scopes requested for the token. 
    - Additional requested scopes should follow the pattern `patient/<ResourceName>.<read/write/*>`
      - `patient/Appointment.*`
      - `patient/Appointment.read patient/Appointment.write`
      - `patient/Patient.read`
      - `patient/Practitioner.read`
    - Canvas provides support for the wildcard character, but highly recommends only requesting the minimal scopes and access needed and using it as a convenience when both read and write are truly required for the application.
###  Example curl request 
    ```bash
    curl --location --request POST \
          'https://<your_subdomain_here>.canvasmedical.com/auth/token/' \
          --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
          --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
          --data-urlencode 'client_id=<client_id_from_Canvas>' \
          --data-urlencode 'client_secret=<client_secret_from_Canvas>' \
          --data-urlencode 'patient=abc123' \
          --data-urlencode 'scope=patient/Patient.read patient/Appointment.* patient/Practitioner.read'
    ```
###  Expected Response Body 
    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "<the_access_token_to_use_in_your_request>", 
      "expires_in": 36000, 
      "token_type": "Bearer", 
      "scope": "patient/Patient.read patient/Appointment.* patient/Practitioner.read", 
      "smart_style_url": "https://canvas-storages.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fhir-static-resources/smart-style.json", 
      "patient": "abc123", 
      "need_patient_banner": true
    }
    ```
Using this access token in subsequent requests ensures that records referencing other patients cannot be retrieved through accidental or malicious misuse of the token. Canvas will also deny requests for any resource types which were not included in `scope` of the token request and requests for resource types which do not support patient-scoped tokens.
**Note:** A patient scoped token must include which patient scopes are being requested. Token requests that include the patient parameter but are missing scope or request invalid scopes will be rejected.

Different patients present unique challenges, and your tools should adapt to meet their specific needs.
Hierarchical condition category (HCC) coding is a critical component of value-based care, especially for organizations serving Medicare Advantage patients. Accurate risk adjustment ensures patients receive appropriate coverage while aligning reimbursement with the complexity of their care needs. However, navigating HCC coding can feel overwhelming with so many diagnoses to consider, guidelines to follow, and tools to use.
This guide will walk you through practical steps to use HCC codings in Canvas for more efficient and effective care delivery. You'll learn how to leverage our [HCC capture plugin](https://github.com/Medical-Software-Foundation/canvas/tree/main/extensions/hcc_capture) to do the following:
  - Create coding gaps from external data using the FHIR DetectedIssue endpoint
  - Surface coding gaps as actionable protocol cards
  - Address and resolve codings gaps seamlessly within the clinical workflow through streamlined commands.
  - Annotate ICD-10 codes that are mapped to HCC categories
By surfacing relevant data when and where it's needed, you can eliminate unnecessary steps, reduce cognitive load, and keep workflows aligned with patient needs.
##  Create Coding Gaps via FHIR Detected Issue 
The [DetectedIssue FHIR resource](/api/detectedissue)) can be used to surface an actual or potential clinical issue with or between one or more active or proposed clinical actions for a patient; e.g. Drug-drug interaction, ineffective treatment frequency, procedure-condition conflict, gaps in care, etc.
A key use case is surfacing potential codings gaps that come from external sources.
The workflow within Canvas is centered around issues created with the `DetectedIssue.code` set to `CODINGGAP`. Although we are leveraging it in our R4 endpoint, `CODINGGAP` was introduced to the value set in R5, and can be used for surfacing conditions that may be present on historical claims but not yet diagnosed within the current year, suspect conditions, or condition data from external sources. The code should be structured as follows:
    ```json
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode",
                    "code": "CODINGGAP"
                }
            ]
        },
    ```
The ICD-10 code can be added to `DetectedIssue.evidence` attribute.
Validated coding gaps (where `DetectedIssue.status` = `preliminary`) will appear in the patient summary if the coding gap commands are enabled in your environment (see more below).
##  Surface New Coding Gaps as Protocol Cards 
Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI) staff often play a crucial role in reviewing potential coding gaps, especially those added via the API using external data.
There is no built in UI feature in Canvas that surfaces coding gaps that have yet to be reviewed for accuracy by staff members. Instead, We haven chosen to leverage plugins to allow for customization within your workflow for surfacing gaps in care. The example protocol below creates a [protocol card](/sdk/effect-protocol-cards/) when a new DetectedIssue is created for a coding gap with a `registered` status. It then recommends that a staff member validates the information before presenting it to a clinician in the summary.
The protocol will surface in each patient's chart and staff can also leverage the population page as a work list.

##  Use Coding Gap Commands to Update the Patient's Record 
The API can be leveraged to create coding gaps in various states. There are also 4 commands for clinicians and staff to manage coding gaps.
  - **Create Coding Gap** serves as a manual way to add coding gaps to the chart. Staff have the ability to create and validate in the same step.
  - **Validate Coding Gap** allows the care team (often CDI Reviewers) to review the external date and confirm that the gap should be surfaced to a clinician.
  - **Assess Coding Gap** allows clinicians to accept or refute the diagnose and choose the appropriate diagnosis to add to the visit.
  - **Defer Coding Gap** allows clinicians to acknowledge the gap and snooze it for a period of time so that they can return to it at a later date. This may be necessary if the patient is unable to provide enough detail or they run out of time during a visit. When recapture rate is an important metric, this allow reporting to reflect an action was taken.
##  Annotate ICD-10 Codes 
Adding an HCC tag as an annotation to ICD-10 is an easy way to increase awareness for clinicians. The example protocols below leverage a static list of ICD-codes. You could also reference a file contained within the plugin pacakge. Depending on which [HCC model](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/medicare-advantage-rates-statistics/risk-adjustment) you follow, you can swap out the codes accordingly.
###  Adding "HCC" to Command Search Results 
The following protocol leverages [command `POST_SEARCH` lifecycle events](/sdk/events/#command-lifecycle-events) and adds an `HCC` annotation to the associated ICD-10 codes within the results for the diagnose, past medical history, create coding gap, and assess coding gap commands.
    ```python
    import json
    from canvas_sdk.effects import Effect, EffectType
    from canvas_sdk.events import EventType
    from canvas_sdk.protocols import BaseProtocol
    ICD_CODES = {
        "HCC": {"A0103", "A0104", "A0105", "A021", "A0222", "A0223", "A0224", "A065", "A072", "A202", "ADD_MORE_CODES..."}
    }
    class AnnotateSearchResults(BaseProtocol):
        RESPONDS_TO = [

            EventType.Name(EventType.ASSESS_CODING_GAP__DIAGNOSE__POST_SEARCH),
        ]
        def compute(self):
            """
            Add HCC code annotation if the HCC code is found in the search results.
            """
            results = self.context.get("results")
            if results is None:
                return [Effect(type=EffectType.AUTOCOMPLETE_SEARCH_RESULTS, payload=json.dumps(None))]
            post_processed_results = []
            for result in self.context["results"]:
                for coding in result.get("extra", {}).get("coding", []):
                    if not coding.get("system") in ("http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10", "ICD-10"):
                        continue
                    if coding.get("code") in ICD_CODES["HCC"]:
                        if result.get("annotations") is None:
                            result["annotations"] = []
                        result["annotations"].append("HCC")
                        break
                post_processed_results.append(result)
            return [
                Effect(
                    type=EffectType.AUTOCOMPLETE_SEARCH_RESULTS,
                    payload=json.dumps(post_processed_results),
                )
            ]
    ```
###  Adding Annotations to Conditions and Detected Issues 
The following event/effect pairings can be leveraged to add annotations (such as the `HCC` tag) to conditions and detected issues in the patient summary as well as on claims using the protocol code below.
  - `CLAIM__CONDITIONS` and `ANNOTATE_CLAIM_CONDITION_RESULTS`
  - `PATIENT_CHART__CONDITIONS` and `ANNOTATE_PATIENT_CHART_CONDITION_RESULTS`
  - `PATIENT_CHART__DETECTED_ISSUES` and `ANNOTATE_PATIENT_CHART_DETECTED_ISSUE_RESULTS`

##  Overview 
[Note Management Plugin](https://github.com/canvas-medical/canvas-plugins/tree/main/example-plugins/note_management_app/note_management_app) demonstrates a complete integration pattern for external applications that need to:
  1. Authorize users via OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE
  2. Automatically refresh access tokens
  3. Call Canvas Simple API endpoints to perform note operations
###  Key Components 
  - **Application Handler** : Launches the web application in a new tab
  - **HTML Application** : Single-page application with OAuth flow and note management UI
  - **API Endpoints** : RESTful API for note operations (lock, sign, unlock, check-in, no-show)
* * *
##  OAuth 2.0 Setup 
###  Step 1: Create an OAuth Application in Canvas 
  1. Log in to your Canvas instance as an administrator
  2. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > OAuth Applications**
  3. Click **Create Application**
  4. Configure the application: 
     - **Name** : `Note Management App` (or your preferred name)
     - **Client Type** : `Public` (for browser-based apps that cannot securely store client secrets)
     - **Authorization Grant Type** : `Authorization Code`
     - **Redirect URIs** : Add your application's redirect URI 
       - For production: `https://your-instance.canvasmedical.com/plugin-io/api/note_sign_api/app`
     - **Scopes** : Add `offline_access` (this allows the app to receive refresh tokens)
  5. **Save** the application
  6. Copy the **Client ID** \- you'll need this in the next step
###  Step 2. Install the Plugin 
    ```bash
    canvas install note_management_app/note_management_app --secret client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
    ```
###  OAuth Flow Details 
####  Authorization Code Flow with PKCE 
This application implements the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), which is the recommended flow for public clients (browser-based applications).
**Why PKCE?**
  - Protects against authorization code interception attacks
  - No client secret needed (suitable for public clients)
  - More secure for browser-based applications
**Flow Steps:**
  1. **Generate Code Verifier and Challenge**
         ```javascript
         // Generate a random string (43-128 characters)
         const codeVerifier = generateRandomString(128);
         // Create SHA-256 hash and base64url encode
         const codeChallenge = await generateCodeChallenge(codeVerifier);
         ```
  2. **Authorization Request**
         ```shell
         GET /auth/authorize/?
           response_type=code&
           client_id={CLIENT_ID}&
           redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&
           scope=offline_access&
           code_challenge={CODE_CHALLENGE}&
           code_challenge_method=S256&
           launch=e30K
         ```
**Parameters:**
     - `response_type=code`: Request an authorization code
     - `client_id`: Your application's client ID
     - `redirect_uri`: Where Canvas will redirect after authorization
     - `scope=offline_access`: Request a refresh token for long-lived access
     - `code_challenge`: Base64url-encoded SHA-256 hash of the code verifier
     - `code_challenge_method=S256`: Indicates SHA-256 hashing
     - `launch=e30K`: Launch context (base64-encoded empty JSON object `{}`)
  3. **User Authorization**
     - User is redirected to Canvas login/authorization page
     - User authenticates and authorizes the application
     - Canvas redirects back to `redirect_uri` with an authorization code
  4. **Token Exchange**
         ```javascript
         POST /auth/token/
         Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
         grant_type=authorization_code&
         code={AUTHORIZATION_CODE}&
         redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&
         client_id={CLIENT_ID}&
         code_verifier={CODE_VERIFIER}
         ```
**Response:**
         ```json
         {
           "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc...",
           "refresh_token": "6KHq3fjkSWQ1vaBbF6WHG9...",
           "token_type": "Bearer",
           "expires_in": 36000,
           "scope": "offline_access"
         }
         ```
**Token Lifetimes:**
     - **Access Token** : Valid for 10 hours (36,000 seconds)
     - **Refresh Token** : Non-expiring, single-use token
  5. **Token Refresh**
         ```javascript
         POST /auth/token/
         Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
         grant_type=refresh_token&
         refresh_token={REFRESH_TOKEN}&
         client_id={CLIENT_ID}&
         scope=offline_access
         ```
**Response:** Returns new access token and new refresh token

    ```
###  Component Overview 
####  1\. Application Handler (`handlers/application.py`) 
The Application handler launches the web application when triggered:
    ```python
    from canvas_sdk.effects import Effect
    from canvas_sdk.effects.launch_modal import LaunchModalEffect
    from canvas_sdk.handlers.application import Application
    class NoteManagementApplication(Application):
        """External note management application with OAuth integration."""
        def on_open(self) -> Effect:
            """Handle the application open event.
            Launches the note management application in a new window.
            """
            # Build the URL to the API endpoint that serves the HTML
            # Using relative path - Canvas will resolve to the correct instance
            app_url = "/plugin-io/api/note_sign_api/app"
            return LaunchModalEffect(
                url=app_url,
                target=LaunchModalEffect.TargetType.NEW_WINDOW,
            ).apply()
    ```
####  2\. App API Handler (`handlers/api.py` \- AppApi class) 
Serves the HTML application:
    ```python
    from http import HTTPStatus
    from canvas_sdk.effects import Effect
    from canvas_sdk.effects.note import Note
    from canvas_sdk.effects.simple_api import HTMLResponse, JSONResponse, Response
    from canvas_sdk.handlers.simple_api import Credentials, SimpleAPI, api
    from canvas_sdk.templates import render_to_string
    from canvas_sdk.v1.data import Note as NoteModel
    class AppApi(SimpleAPI):
        """API handler for serving the note management application."""
        PREFIX = ""
        def authenticate(self, credentials: Credentials) -> bool:
            """Allow access without authentication.
            The OAuth flow will handle authentication within the app.
            """
            return True
        @api.get("/app")
        def note_management_app(self) -> list[Response | Effect]:
            """Serve the note management application HTML."""
            # Get the Canvas instance URL from the request Host header
            host = self.request.headers.get("Host", "localhost:8000")
            # Determine protocol based on host
            if "localhost" in host or "127.0.0.1" in host:
                canvas_instance = f"http://{host}"
            else:
                canvas_instance = f"https://{host}"
            # Render the HTML template with context
            context = {"canvas_instance": canvas_instance}
            return [
                HTMLResponse(
                    render_to_string("templates/note_management_app.html", context),
                    status_code=HTTPStatus.OK,
                )
            ]
    ```
####  3\. Note API Handler (`handlers/api.py` \- NoteApi class) 
Provides RESTful API endpoints for note operations:
    ```python
    from http import HTTPStatus
    from canvas_sdk.effects import Effect
    from canvas_sdk.effects.note import Note
    from canvas_sdk.effects.simple_api import HTMLResponse, JSONResponse, Response
    from canvas_sdk.handlers.simple_api import Credentials, SimpleAPI, api
    from canvas_sdk.templates import render_to_string
    from canvas_sdk.v1.data import Note as NoteModel
    class NoteApi(SimpleAPI):
        """API handler for note-related operations."""
        PREFIX = "/notes"
        def authenticate(self, credentials: Credentials) -> bool:
            """Authenticate requests."""
            return self.event.actor.instance is not None
        @api.post("/<id>/lock")
        def lock_note(self) -> list[Response | Effect]:
            """Lock a note."""
            note_id = self.request.path_params["id"]
            try:
                note_instance = NoteModel.objects.get(id=note_id)
            except NoteModel.DoesNotExist:
                return [
                    JSONResponse(
                        {"error": "Note not found."},
                        status_code=404,
                    )
                ]
            note = Note(instance_id=note_instance.id)
            return [note.lock()]
    ```
* * *
##  Implementation Details 
####  Key JavaScript Functions 
#####  PKCE Implementation 
    ```javascript
    // Generate random string for code verifier
    function generateRandomString(length) {
        const charset = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-._~';
        let result = '';
        const randomValues = new Uint8Array(length);
        crypto.getRandomValues(randomValues);
        for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            result += charset[randomValues[i] % charset.length];
        }
        return result;
    }
    // Generate code challenge from verifier
    async function generateCodeChallenge(codeVerifier) {
        const encoder = new TextEncoder();
        const data = encoder.encode(codeVerifier);
        const hash = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data);
        const base64 = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(hash)));
        return base64.replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=/g, '');
    }
    ```
#####  OAuth Initiation 
    ```javascript
    async function initiateOAuth() {
        // Generate PKCE values
        const codeVerifier = generateRandomString(128);
        const codeChallenge = await generateCodeChallenge(codeVerifier);
        // Store verifier for token exchange
        sessionStorage.setItem('code_verifier', codeVerifier);
        // Build authorization URL
        const authUrl = `${CANVAS_INSTANCE}/auth/authorize/?` +
            `response_type=code` +
            `&client_id=${encodeURIComponent(CLIENT_ID)}` +
            `&redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(REDIRECT_URI)}` +
            `&scope=${encodeURIComponent(SCOPES)}` +
            `&code_challenge=${codeChallenge}` +
            `&code_challenge_method=S256` +
            `&launch=${LAUNCH_CONTEXT}`;
        // Redirect to Canvas authorization
        window.location.href = authUrl;
    }
    ```
#####  Token Exchange 
    ```javascript
    async function handleAuthCallback() {
        const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
        const code = urlParams.get('code');
        if (code) {
            const codeVerifier = sessionStorage.getItem('code_verifier');
            const response = await fetch(`${CANVAS_INSTANCE}/auth/token/`, {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
                },
                body: new URLSearchParams({
                    grant_type: 'authorization_code',
                    code: code,
                    redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI,
                    client_id: CLIENT_ID,
                    code_verifier: codeVerifier
                })
            });
            const data = await response.json();
            saveTokens(data);
            // Clean up
            window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, window.location.pathname);
            sessionStorage.removeItem('code_verifier');
            updateUI();
        }
    }
    ```
#####  Token Storage and Refresh 
    ```javascript
    function saveTokens(tokenData) {
        localStorage.setItem(ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY, tokenData.access_token);
        localStorage.setItem(REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY, tokenData.refresh_token);
        // Calculate expiry time
        const expiryTime = Date.now() + (tokenData.expires_in * 1000);
        localStorage.setItem(TOKEN_EXPIRY_KEY, expiryTime.toString());
        // Schedule refresh 5 minutes before expiry
        scheduleTokenRefresh(tokenData.expires_in - 300);
    }
    async function refreshAccessToken() {
        const refreshToken = localStorage.getItem(REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY);
        const response = await fetch(`${CANVAS_INSTANCE}/auth/token/`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
            },
            body: new URLSearchParams({
                grant_type: 'refresh_token',
                refresh_token: refreshToken,
                client_id: CLIENT_ID
            })
        });
        const data = await response.json();
        saveTokens(data);
        showSuccess('Access token refreshed automatically');
    }
    ```
#####  API Calls 
    ```javascript
    async function performAction(action) {
        const noteId = document.getElementById('noteId').value.trim();
        const accessToken = localStorage.getItem(ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY);
        const actionMap = {
            'lock': '/lock',
            'sign': '/sign',
            'unlock': '/unlock',
            'lock_sign': '/lock_sign',
            'checkin': '/checkin',
            'noshow': '/noshow'
        };
        const endpoint = actionMap[action];
        const response = await fetch(
            `${CANVAS_INSTANCE}/plugins/note_sign_api/notes/${noteId}${endpoint}`,
            {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: {
                    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
                }
            }
        );
        if (!response.ok) {
            // Handle errors, possibly refresh token if 401
            if (response.status === 401) {
                await refreshAccessToken();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

##  Security Considerations 
###  1\. Token Storage 
**Current Implementation** : Tokens are stored in `localStorage`
**Considerations** :
  - `localStorage` is vulnerable to XSS attacks
  - For production, consider using: 
    - HTTP-only cookies (requires backend support)
    - Session storage (cleared when tab closes)
    - Encrypted storage solutions
###  2\. PKCE Protection 
  - PKCE prevents authorization code interception attacks
  - Code verifier is stored in `sessionStorage` (temporary)
  - Code challenge is sent to authorization server
  - Server verifies verifier matches challenge during token exchange
###  3\. Token Refresh 
  - Refresh tokens are single-use (Canvas rotates them)
  - Access tokens are short-lived (10 hours)
  - Automatic refresh happens before expiry
  - Failed refresh triggers re-authentication
###  4\. API Authentication 
> **⚠️ Important** : The current implementation relies on the OAuth-authenticated user from Canvas. This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes.
**Current Implementation** :
    ```python
    from canvas_sdk.handlers.simple_api import Credentials
    def authenticate(self, credentials: Credentials) -> bool:
        return self.event.actor.instance is not None
    ```
This basic authentication check verifies that there is an authenticated Canvas user making the request.
**Production Recommendations** :
See the official documentation for supported authentication mechanisms: [Canvas SDK Authentication Guide](https://docs.canvasmedical.com/sdk/handlers-simple-api-http/#authentication)

----- BEGIN PAGE https://docs.canvasmedical.com/guides/staying-on-top-of-tasks/
Many Canvas users work in multiple systems. If you have a system that deals with tasks that are ultimately completed in Canvas, you'll want to manage the full task lifecycle from that external system. Using Canvas' [FHIR API](/api/) and the [Canvas SDK](/sdk/), you can have your system create tasks in Canvas, and get notified when your users complete them.
![](/assets/images/guides/staying-on-top-of-tasks/flow.png)
##  Creating Tasks with the FHIR API 
Your system can originate Tasks in Canvas using our FHIR [Task Create endpoint](/api/task/#create). The id of the task you create can be found in the `location` response header. It comes back as the FHIR Task Read URL, but you can parse the id from it. See the example below. Remember, this code is hitting the Canvas API from _your_ system, not from within Canvas.
    ```python
    import requests
    import json
    payload = json.dumps({
      "resourceType": "Task",
      "status": "requested",
      "intent": "unknown",
      "description": "Send a thank you card to the office admin team.",
      "requester": {
        "reference": "Practitioner/abc123"
      }
    })
    url = "https://fumage-api-test-clinic.canvasmedical.com/Task"
    headers = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'not-a-real-token'
    }
    response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
    # find the id of the task we just created
    task_location = response.headers['location']  # http://fumage-api-test-clinic.canvasmedical.com/Task/b6426693-eb5b-4702-9f90-4728972c7f16
    task_id = task_location.split("/Task/")[1]  # b6426693-eb5b-4702-9f90-4728972c7f16
    ```
You can then take that task id and persist it in your application for tracking its status. While some choose to poll for status changes, a better way to keep track of the state of a task is by creating a webhook. We can do that with the Canvas SDK.
##  Creating a Task completion webhook with the Canvas SDK 
> **Info:** Webhook plugins are discussed in more detail in [Creating Webhooks with the Canvas SDK](/guides/creating-webhooks-with-the-canvas-sdk/). 
Implementing webhooks in a plugin gives you ultimate control over the payload and headers in your request. We use the python [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library under the hood, so there's an extremely good chance anything you require for your request is supported.
In this example, we listen for either the `TASK_COMPLETED` or the `TASK_CLOSED` events, and send an HTTP POST with the id of the task that was either completed or closed, along with whether it was completed or closed. The target of the event is the id of the task, so the event comes with all the information we need here. You can substitute any of the Canvas SDK's supported [events](/sdk/events/) to extend this example to other record types.
    ```python
    from canvas_sdk.events import EventType
    from canvas_sdk.handlers.base import BaseHandler
    from canvas_sdk.utils import Http
    from logger import log
    class TaskResolutionWebhook(BaseHandler):
        RESPONDS_TO = [
            EventType.Name(EventType.TASK_COMPLETED),
            EventType.Name(EventType.TASK_CLOSED),
        ]
        def compute(self):
            task_disposition = 'closed'
            if self.event.type == EventType.TASK_COMPLETED:
                task_disposition = 'completed'
            url = "https://webhook.site/ee7aed78-b652-4d9e-b858-04465c409d15"
            payload = {
                "task_id": self.target,
                "disposition": task_disposition,
            }
            http = Http()
            response = http.post(url, json=payload)
            if response.ok:
                log.info("Successfully notified API of task update!")
            else:
                log.info("Notification unsuccessful. =[")
            return []
    ```
Once installed, the url you specified in the code will receive an HTTP POST request whenever a user marks a task as completed or closed. Your application can listen for those requests and update your internal status of that task.

Inside of the Canvas' [Vital Command](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/9426091672-command-vitals) there are many vital signs supported to document.
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/vitals/vital-empty.png)
The Canvas [FHIR Observation Create](/api/observation/#create) endpoint supports writing some of the vital signs in the command. This guide will show you all the vitals that can be documented in the Create interaction.
* * *
##  What you'll learn 
In this guide, you will learn how to do the following:
  1. Create a vital panel via FHIR
  2. Submit various vital signs into the same panel via FHIR
  3. Perform a FHIR Observation Search to view the completed panel
* * *
###  1\. Setup and Authentication 
This guide will demonstrate many FHIR API calls into Canvas. Before we can make a FHIR request, we need to setup some imports, reusable variables, and authenticate into the instance we want to work with.
Here is your starting point:
    ```python
    import requests
    url = "https://fumage-example.canvasmedical.com/Observation"
    headers = {
        "accept": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
        "content-type": "application/json"
    }
    ```
But there are two places above to update:
  1. The `url` will show `https://fumage-example.canvasmedical.com/Observation`. You will need to replace `example` with the name of the Canvas instance you are using.
  2. One of the `header` elements will be `'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'`. You will need to create this `<token>` following our steps laid out in [Customer Authentication](/api/customer-authentication)
###  2\. Understanding our Observation Payload 
Before we start creating the vital panel and the associated vital signs, take some time to familiarize yourself with the [FHIR Observation Create](/api/observation/#create) endpoint. Each payload to create an observation requires `status`, `code`, and `subject`.
In this guide the `status` will always be `final` and the `subject` will always appear as:   
`"subject": { "reference": "Patient/$patient_id" }`.  
When completing these steps yourself, you will want to change the `{patient_id}` to match a patient in the instance you are using (e.g `"Patient/ee8672f3497e4a83937b9e71d0a704a5"`).
The `code` attribute is the real magic that tells Canvas which vital you are creating. The coding will always be a LOINC code.
Another thing to note is an optional `effectiveDateTime` attribute. This allows you to specify the time the vital was taken. But if omitted, it will default to the time of creation.
###  3\. Create a Vital Panel 
First we will need to create the panel object to be able to save all the individual vital signs to. The important attribute is the `code.coding[0][code]` being `85353-1` to represent a vital panel.
Here is the payload for how to create a Vital Panel (remember to set the patient_id and also update the effectiveDateTime):
    ```python
    import requests
    url = "https://fumage-example.canvasmedical.com/Observation"
    headers = {
        "accept": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
        "content-type": "application/json"
    }
    patient_id = "<a patient ID from your instance>"
    payload = {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "85353-1",
                    "display": "Vital Panel"
                }
            ]
        },
        "subject": {
            "reference": f"Patient/{patient_id}"
        },
        "effectiveDateTime": "2024-03-29T08:50:24.883809+00:00"
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    ```
On a successful create, when the `response.status_code` equal 201. We can fetch the ID of the newly created observation in the `response.headers['location']` attribute. The value will always be in the format `{url}/{id}/_history/1`. We need to extract the `id` from the value.
However, if the request failed it will throw an error to see what went wrong. It will also display the Correlation ID that can be given to Customer Support for help with further debugging.
    ```python
    if response.status_code == 201:
        panel_id = response.headers['location'].replace(f"{url.replace('https', 'http')}/", '').replace('/_history/1', '')
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
Looking in the Canvas UI, there will now be a Data Import note placed on that patient's timeline based on the date passed in the `effectiveDateTime` attribute with an empty Vitals Command:
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/vitals/vital-panel-in-import-note.png)
###  4\. Creating Individual Vital Signs 
Now that we have created a Vital Panel, we will be able to use this panel_id when creating the individual vital signs to be associated with the same command by passing the `derivedFrom` attribute in the payload:
    ```python
    payload = {
        # ...
        "derivedFrom": [
            {
                "reference": f"Observation/{panel_id}",
                "type": "Observation"
            }
        ],
        # ...
    }
    ```
Now we are ready to create the following vital signs in the panel that are supported via FHIR Observation Create:
  - Height
  - Weight
  - Waist Circumference
  - Body Temperature
  - Blood Pressure
  - Pulse Rhythm
  - Pulse Rate
  - Respiration Rate
  - Oxygen Saturation
  - Notes
####  Add Height 
Height is denoted by the LOINC code `8302-2`. Since its value is numeric, we will be able to pass the value and units through the `valueQuantity` attribute. By default if no `valueQuantity.unit` is specified, it will default to using inches, but `cm` is also supported, it will just convert it to inches on the UI and when a Read/Search is performed.
Here is a payload to create a height of 69.0 inches:
    ```python
    payload = {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "8302-2",
                    "display": "Height"
                }
            ]
        },
        "subject": {
            "reference": f"Patient/{patient_id}"
        },
        "effectiveDateTime": "2024-03-29T08:50:24.883809+00:00",
        "valueQuantity": {
            "value": 69.0,
            "unit": "in",
        },
        "derivedFrom": [
            {
                "reference": f"Observation/{panel_id}",
                "type": "Observation"
            }
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Height observation id = {response.headers['location'].replace(f'{url}/', '').replace('/_history/1', '')}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
Looking in the Canvas UI, there will now be height of `69.0 in` added in that Vitals Command:
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/vitals/height.png)
####  Add Weight 
Weight is denoted by the LOINC code `29463-7`. Since its value is numeric, we will be able to pass the value and units through the `valueQuantity` attribute. By default if no `valueQuantity.unit` is specified, it will default to using ounces, but `lb` or `kg` is also supported, it will just convert it to `oz` when a Read/Search is performed. The UI will display it in `lbs` and leftover `oz`.
Here is a payload to create a weight of 176.4 lbs:
    ```python
    payload = {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "29463-7",
                    "display": "Weight"
                }
            ]
        },
        "subject": {
            "reference": f"Patient/{patient_id}"
        },
        "effectiveDateTime": "2024-03-29T08:50:24.883809+00:00",
        "valueQuantity": {
            "value": 176.4,
            "unit": "lb",
        },
        "derivedFrom": [
            {
                "reference": f"Observation/{panel_id}",
                "type": "Observation"
            }
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Weight observation id = {response.headers['location'].replace(f'{url}/', '').replace('/_history/1', '')}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
Looking in the Canvas UI, there will now be weight of `176 lbs 6.4 oz` added in that Vitals Command:
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/vitals/weight.png)
####  Add Waist Circumference 
Waist Circumference is denoted by the LOINC code `29463-7`. Since its value is numeric, we will be able to pass the value and units through the `valueQuantity` attribute. By default if no `valueQuantity.unit` is specified, it will default to using centimeters, but `in` is also supported, it will just convert it to `cm` on the UI or when a Read/Search is performed.
Here is a payload to create a waist circumference of `98.2 cm`:
    ```python
    payload = {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "56086-2",
                    "display": "Waist Circumference"
                }
            ]
        },
        "subject": {
            "reference": f"Patient/{patient_id}"
        },
        "effectiveDateTime": "2024-03-29T08:50:24.883809+00:00",
        "valueQuantity": {
            "value": 98.2,
            "unit": "cm",
        },
        "derivedFrom": [
            {
                "reference": f"Observation/{panel_id}",
                "type": "Observation"
            }
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Waist Circumference observation id = {response.headers['location'].replace(f'{url}/', '').replace('/_history/1', '')}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
Looking in the Canvas UI, there will now be waist circumference of `98.2 cm` added in that Vitals Command:
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/vitals/waist-circumference.png)
####  Add Body Temperature 
Body Temperature is denoted by the LOINC code `8310-5`. Since its value is numeric, we will be able to pass the value and units through the `valueQuantity` attribute. The only unit accepted for body temperature is `°F` and if omitted it will be default.
Here is a payload to create a temperature of `98.4 °F`:
    ```python
    payload = {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "8310-5",
                    "display": "Body Temperature"
                }
            ]
        },
        "subject": {
            "reference": f"Patient/{patient_id}"
        },
        "effectiveDateTime": "2024-03-29T08:50:24.883809+00:00",
        "valueQuantity": {
            "value": 98.4,
            "unit": "°F",
        },
        "derivedFrom": [
            {
                "reference": f"Observation/{panel_id}",
                "type": "Observation"
            }
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Body Temperature observation id = {response.headers['location'].replace(f'{url}/', '').replace('/_history/1', '')}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
Looking in the Canvas UI, there will now be temperature of `98.4 °F` added in that Vitals Command:
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/vitals/body-temperature.png)
####  Add Blood Pressure 
Blood Pressure is denoted by the LOINC code `85354-9`. In the Vital's command blood pressure is a string value that combines the systolic and diastolic components with a `/`. So the payload will pass the `valueString` component in order for the blood pressure to appear correctly in the Vitals Command.
Since blood pressure is made up of two values, the payload will also define a `component` attribute list to pass the systolic (LOINC code `8480-6`) and diastolic (LOINC code `8462-4`) values. These two values are numeric, so they will have the `valueQuantity` attributes where the unit will be `mmHg`
Here is a payload to create a Blood Pressure of `122/68`:
    ```python
    payload = {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "85354-9",
                    "display": "Blood Pressure"
                }
            ]
        },
        "subject": {
            "reference": f"Patient/{patient_id}"
        },
        "effectiveDateTime": "2024-03-29T08:50:24.883809+00:00",
        "valueString": "122/68",
        "component": [
            {
                "code": {
                    "coding": [
                        {
                            "system": "http://loinc.org",
                            "code": "8480-6",
                            "display": "Systolic blood pressure"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "valueQuantity": {
                    "value": 122,
                    "unit": "mmHg"
                }
            },
            {
                "code": {
                    "coding": [
                        {
                            "system": "http://loinc.org",
                            "code": "8462-4",
                            "display": "Diastolic blood pressure"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "valueQuantity": {
                    "value": 68,
                    "unit": "mmHg"
                }
            }
        ],
        "derivedFrom": [
            {
                "reference": f"Observation/{panel_id}",
                "type": "Observation"
            }
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Blood Pressure observation id = {response.headers['location'].replace(f'{url}/', '').replace('/_history/1', '')}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
Looking in the Canvas UI, there will now be blood pressure of `122/68` added in that Vitals Command:
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/vitals/blood-pressure.png)
####  Add Pulse Rate 
Pulse Rate is denoted by the LOINC code `8867-4`. Since its value is numeric, we will be able to pass the value and units through the `valueQuantity` attribute. The only unit accepted for pulse rate is `bpm` and if omitted it will be default.
Here is a payload to create a pulse rate of `115 bpm`:
    ```python
    payload = {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "8867-4",
                    "display": "Pulse"
                }
            ]
        },
        "subject": {
            "reference": f"Patient/{patient_id}"
        },
        "effectiveDateTime": "2024-03-29T08:50:24.883809+00:00",
        "valueQuantity": {
            "value": 115,
            "unit": "bpm",
        },
        "derivedFrom": [
            {
                "reference": f"Observation/{panel_id}",
                "type": "Observation"
            }
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Pulse Rate observation id = {response.headers['location'].replace(f'{url}/', '').replace('/_history/1', '')}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
Looking in the Canvas UI, there will now be pulse rate of `115 bpm` added in that Vitals Command:

####  Add Pulse Rhythm 
Pulse Rhythm is denoted by the LOINC code `8884-9`. Canvas accepts only three different string values for pulse rhythm: `Regular`, `Irregularly Irregular`, or `Regulary Irregular`. This value will be passed in the `valueString` attribute.
Here is a payload to create a pulse rhythm of `Regular`:
    ```python
    payload = {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "8884-9",
                    "display": "Pulse Rhythm"
                }
            ]
        },
        "subject": {
            "reference": f"Patient/{patient_id}"
        },
        "effectiveDateTime": "2024-03-29T08:50:24.883809+00:00",
        "valueString": "Regular",
        "derivedFrom": [
            {
                "reference": f"Observation/{panel_id}",
                "type": "Observation"
            }
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Pulse rhythm observation id = {response.headers['location'].replace(f'{url}/', '').replace('/_history/1', '')}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
Looking in the Canvas UI, there will now be pulse rhythm of `Regular` added in that Vitals Command:
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/vitals/pulse-rhythm.png)
####  Add Respiration Rate 
Respiration Rate is denoted by the LOINC code `9279-1`. Since its value is numeric, we will be able to pass the value and units through the `valueQuantity` attribute. The only unit accepted for respiration rate is `bpm` and if omitted it will be default.
Here is a payload to create a respiration rate of `15 bpm`:
    ```python
    payload = {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "9279-1",
                    "display": "Respiration Rate"
                }
            ]
        },
        "subject": {
            "reference": f"Patient/{patient_id}"
        },
        "effectiveDateTime": "2024-03-29T08:50:24.883809+00:00",
        "valueQuantity": {
            "value": 15,
            "unit": "bpm",
        },
        "derivedFrom": [
            {
                "reference": f"Observation/{panel_id}",
                "type": "Observation"
            }
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Respiration Rate observation id = {response.headers['location'].replace(f'{url}/', '').replace('/_history/1', '')}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
Looking in the Canvas UI, there will now be respiration rate of `15 bpm` added in that Vitals Command:
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/vitals/respiration-rate.png)
####  Add Oxygen Saturation 
Oxygen Saturation is denoted by either LOINC code `2708-6` or `59408-5`. Canvas saves the oxygen saturation with both codings. Since its value is numeric, we will be able to pass the value and units through the `valueQuantity` attribute. The only unit accepted for Oxygen Saturation is `%` and if omitted it will be default.
Here is a payload to create a Oxygen Saturation of `98%`:
    ```python
    payload = {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "2708-6",
                    "display": "Oxygen Saturation Arterial"
                },
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "59408-5",
                    "display": "Oxygen Saturation"
                }
            ]
        },
        "subject": {
            "reference": f"Patient/{patient_id}"
        },
        "effectiveDateTime": "2024-03-29T08:50:24.883809+00:00",
        "valueQuantity": {
            "value": 98,
            "unit": "%",
        },
        "derivedFrom": [
            {
                "reference": f"Observation/{panel_id}",
                "type": "Observation"
            }
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Oxygen Saturation observation id = {response.headers['location'].replace(f'{url}/', '').replace('/_history/1', '')}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
Looking in the Canvas UI, there will now be Oxygen Saturation of `98%` added in that Vitals Command:
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/vitals/oxygen-saturation.png)
####  Add Notes 
Adding a Note is denoted by the LOINC code `80339-5`. Since this value is free text, a `valueString` attribute can be used.
Here is a payload to create an internal Note:
    ```python
    payload = {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
            "coding": [
                {
                    "system": "http://loinc.org",
                    "code": "80339-5",
                    "display": "Note"
                }
            ]
        },
        "subject": {
            "reference": f"Patient/{patient_id}"
        },
        "effectiveDateTime": "2024-03-29T08:50:24.883809+00:00",
        "valueString": "Last Blood sugar was 78",
        "derivedFrom": [
            {
                "reference": f"Observation/{panel_id}",
                "type": "Observation"
            }
        ]
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Oxygen Saturation observation id = {response.headers['location'].replace(f'{url}/', '').replace('/_history/1', '')}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
Looking in the Canvas UI, there will now will be a Note added in that Vitals Command:
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/vitals/note.png)
###  5\. Perform FHIR Observation Read and Search 
A full Vital Panel has been completed! Let's now perform a FHIR Observation Read using the `panel_id` to see all the observation members of this panel now:
    ```python
    from pprint import pprint
    response = requests.get(f"{url}/{panel_id}", headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        pprint(response.json())
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
The output will look like:
    ```json
    {
        "resourceType": "Observation",

And finally let's perform a FHIR Observation Search to see all the vital signs that are for that patient using the derived from search parameter:
    ```python
    from pprint import pprint
    response = requests.get(f"{url}?patient=Patient/{patient_id}&category=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category|vital-signs&derived-from=Observation/{panel_id}&_count=20", headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        pprint(response.json())
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to perform {response.url}. \n Fumage Correlation ID: {response.headers['fumage-correlation-id']} \n {response.text}")
    ```
The response will look like:
